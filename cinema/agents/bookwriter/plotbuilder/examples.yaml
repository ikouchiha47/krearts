        ## Example: "Ashford's Shadow"
        <example>
        EXT. ASHFORD ESTATE - DAY

        Police tape comes down. The monolithic mansion looks slightly
        less imposing in the daylight, but the shadows remain long.

        MARGARET ASHFORD (57), dressed in severe black, stands on
        the portico. She looks powerful, free, watching the final
        patrol car pull away.

        DETECTIVE MORGAN (46) approaches her, his trench coat
        rumpled.

                        MORGAN
                Mrs. Ashford. James Butler has
                confessed and is in custody. Dr.
                Price is charged as an accomplice.
                You are officially cleared of all
                suspicion.

                        MARGARET
                I knew it wasn't me, Detective.
                    (a small, dry smile)
                But I appreciate the thoroughness.
                Most would have stopped at the
                locket.

                        MORGAN
                I don't stop at easy answers, Mrs.
                Ashford. They tend to be the
                costliest lies.

                        MARGARET
                So, the man who served him for
                thirty years finally broke his
                chain. Irony is cruel, isn't it?

                        MORGAN
                Justice is simply finding the truth
                hidden in the convenience.

        Margaret looks out over the vast, empty grounds.

                        MARGARET
                What happens to this now? The
                house? The fortune?

                        MORGAN
                That, Mrs. Ashford, is no longer
                my jurisdiction.

        Morgan turns to leave.

                        MARGARET
                Detective Morgan.

        He pauses, turning back to face her.

                        MARGARET (CONT'D)
                You found the killer. But you also
                found the truth. Thank you.

        Morgan simply clicks his silver lighter once -- a quiet
        affirmation. He walks toward his car, blending into the
        shadows.

        ## Beat Plan Example (per scene)

        <example>
        EXT. ASHFORD ESTATE - NIGHT
        Beat Plan:
        - A:
            Shot Type: establishing
            Visible Focus: Manor scale; security camera beaded with rain; front door brass plate
            Composition Notes: high-angle, leading lines of driveway to door; deep focus
            Light & Atmosphere: headlights through fog, rain sheets, overflowing gutters
            Motion Cues: strobe reflections across steps; wind-driven rain
            Foreshadow/Clue Scaffold: security camera staring outward
            Narrator: "Power wears stone and shadow; the rain edits nothing."
            Backstory Drip (trigger: camera): "The Ashfords prized surveillance over trust."
        - B:
            Shot Type: medium
            Visible Focus: Detective stepping from sedan; Zippo flame in wet spectacles
            Composition Notes: low three-quarter; rule-of-thirds on eyes; background police tape diagonal
            Light & Atmosphere: harsh headlight backlight; rain beads on tweed; smoke drift
            Motion Cues: wind tears smoke sideways
            Foreshadow/Clue Scaffold: meticulous lighter—a habit that recurs at reveals
            Narrator: "He inventories the night: light, water, and the lie they carry."
        - C:
            Shot Type: close-up
            Visible Focus: brass plate with a faint wiped oval and linear edge streak
            Composition Notes: shallow depth; isolate smear; background dissolves to grey
            Light & Atmosphere: strobing reflections on metal; steady runoff
            Motion Cues: water streaming across plate
            Foreshadow/Clue Scaffold: wiped area suggests gloved touch (later glove residue)
            Narrator: "Clean is a story; patterns betray the editor."

The narrative weaves between present-day investigation and past events, revealing how Butler's resentment grew over years of humiliation. The climax comes when Morgan pieces together the timeline, realizing that only Butler had the opportunity and means to commit the murder. The resolution shows Butler's confession, driven not by Morgan's evidence, but by his own guilt and the weight of his actions.",
