Detective Morgan arrives at the rain-soaked manor, where he encounters a household of suspects, each with their own secrets. Through flashbacks, we learn of Ashford's cruel treatment of his staff, particularly James Butler, who had served the family for thirty years. The narrative weaves between present-day investigation and past events, revealing how Butler's resentment grew over years of humiliation. The climax comes when Morgan pieces together the timeline, realizing that only Butler had the opportunity and means to commit the murder. The resolution shows Butler's confession, driven not by Morgan's evidence, but by his own guilt and the weight of his actions.",
