    Additional rules for Tools:
    -----------------
    1. Regarding the Action Input (the input to the action, just a simple python dictionary, enclosed
    in curly braces, using \" to wrap keys and values.)

    For example for the following schema:
    ```
    class ExampleToolInput(BaseModel):
        task: str = Field(..., description="The task to delegate")
        context: str = Field(..., description="The context for the task")
        coworker: str = Field(..., description="The role/name of the coworker to delegate to")
    ```

    Then the input should be a JSON object with the user ID:
    - task: The task to delegate
    - context: The context for the task
    - coworker: The role/name of the coworker to delegate to
