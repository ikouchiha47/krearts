    ### EXAMPLE 1

    FADE IN:

    EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

    SUPER: "DETROIT - 2:47 AM"

    Rain hammers down. Lightning illuminates a crumbling industrial 
    complex.

    DETECTIVE KATE RUSSO (32, leather jacket, gun drawn) moves 
    along the wall. Water drips from her hair.

    She presses against the corner. Peers around.

    KATE
    (into radio)
    I've got eyes on the south entrance.
    No movement.

    DISPATCH (V.O.)
    (crackling)
    Copy that. Backup is three minutes out.

    KATE
    I'm going in.

    She checks her clip. Slides it back. Deep breath.

    ANGLE ON - Warehouse door, slightly ajar.

    Kate approaches slowly. Each step deliberate.

    CLOSE ON - Her hand on the door handle.

    She pushes. CREAAAK.

    INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

    Darkness. Kate's flashlight beam cuts through.

    Abandoned machinery. Graffiti-covered walls. The beam lands on—

    A CHAIR in the center. Empty. Rope on the ground.

    KATE
    Shit.

    WHOOSH! A FIGURE tackles her from behind.

    The flashlight CLATTERS away, spinning.

    SMASH CUT TO:

    EXT. WAREHOUSE ROOF - SAME TIME

    A SNIPER (40s, tactical gear) adjusts his scope.

    SNIPER
    (into comms)
    Target has engaged. I don't have a 
    clean shot.

    INTERCUT - WAREHOUSE INTERIOR/ROOF

    Kate struggles with her attacker. Throws an elbow. Connects.

    SNIPER (CONT'D)
    She's holding her own. Stand by.

    Kate gains the upper hand. Pins the attacker.

    KATE
    Where is she? WHERE IS SHE?

    The attacker laughs. Blood on his teeth.

    ATTACKER
    You're too late, Detective.

    SLOW MOTION - Kate's face. Realization.

    MATCH CUT TO:

    INT. BASEMENT - UNKNOWN LOCATION - NIGHT

    A WOMAN (20s) bound to a chair. Tape over her mouth. Eyes wide 
    with terror.

    Water rises around her ankles.

    BACK TO SCENE - REGULAR SPEED

    Kate stands. Grabs her radio.

    KATE
    We need search teams. Now. She's 
    somewhere flooding.

    She looks at the attacker.

    KATE (CONT'D)
    You're going to tell me where.

    ATTACKER
    (smiling)
    Clock's ticking.

    PUSH IN on Kate's face. Determination.

    DISSOLVE TO:
    ----

    ### Example 2: Drama with Montage and Flashbacks

    INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

    Sterile. Quiet except for the BEEP of monitors.

    MICHAEL (50s, grey stubble, hospital gown) lies in bed. His 
    daughter EMMA (24, red eyes from crying) sits beside him.

    EMMA
    The doctors say you're responding well 
    to treatment.

    Michael doesn't respond. Stares at the ceiling.

    EMMA (CONT'D)
    Dad?

    MICHAEL
    (hoarse)
    How's your mother?

    Emma looks away.

    EMMA
    She's... she's at the hotel. She 
    couldn't—
    (beat)
    She needs time.

    MICHAEL
    Twenty-six years. Guess she's had 
    enough time.

    FLASHBACK - INT. FAMILY HOME - KITCHEN - DAY (10 YEARS EARLIER)

    YOUNGER MICHAEL and his wife DIANE (40s) argue. Emma, 14, 
    watches from the doorway.

    DIANE
    You promised! You swore you'd quit!

    YOUNGER MICHAEL
    It's one job. One last job and we're 
    set.

    DIANE
    That's what you said five jobs ago!

    Emma runs upstairs. FOOTSTEPS echo.

    BACK TO PRESENT

    EMMA
    She still loves you, Dad.

    MICHAEL
    (bitter laugh)
    Funny way of showing it.

    Emma stands. Goes to the window.

    EMMA
    You know what I remember most? The 
    waiting.
    (turns to him)
    Waiting for you to come home. Waiting 
    for the phone to ring. Waiting to find 
    out if you were alive or dead.

    Michael closes his eyes.

    MICHAEL
    Em—

    EMMA
    I'm not finished.
    (beat)
    I remember Mom sitting by the window 
    every night. Just... sitting there.

    SERIES OF SHOTS - FLASHBACK MONTAGE

    -- Young Emma at her piano recital. The audience. Empty seat 
    where Michael should be.

    -- Diane alone at the kitchen table. Bills spread out. Her head 
    in her hands.

    -- Emma's high school graduation. She searches the crowd. No 
    Michael.

    -- Diane crying in the bedroom. Emma (17) hugging her.

    BACK TO PRESENT

    Tears stream down Emma's face.

    EMMA
    She waited. We both did.
    (beat)
    Now it's your turn to wait. To fight. 
    To be here.

    Michael reaches out. Takes her hand.

    MICHAEL
    (voice breaking)
    I'm sorry. God, Em, I'm so sorry.

    They hold each other.

    FADE TO:

    EXT. HOSPITAL - SUNSET

    The building silhouetted against an orange sky.

    DISSOLVE TO:

    ### Example 3: Comedy with Proper Formatting

    INT. ACCOUNTING OFFICE - CUBICLE FARM - DAY

    Fluorescent lights hum. Keyboards CLACK. Soul-crushing 
    normalcy.

    SUPER: "MONDAY - 9:03 AM"

    JOSH PARKER (28, rumpled tie, desperate eyes) hunches over his 
    desk. He glances around nervously.

    His computer screen: "FANTASY FOOTBALL - TRADE DEADLINE: 47 
    MINUTES"

    His BOSS, MR. HENDRICKS (55, suit, permanent scowl) walks past.

    Josh quickly switches screens to a spreadsheet.

    MR. HENDRICKS
    (without stopping)
    Parker. Conference room. Five minutes.

    Josh's eyes go wide.

    JOSH
    (under his breath)
    Crap crap crap crap crap.

    His coworker MAYA (26, glasses, smirking) leans over the 
    divider.

    MAYA
    What'd you do this time?

    JOSH
    Nothing! I haven't done anything!

    MAYA
    That's what you said before the copier 
    incident.

    JOSH
    That wasn't my fault!

    FLASHBACK - INT. COPY ROOM - LAST WEEK

    Josh stands before a copy machine. Paper EVERYWHERE. The 
    machine SMOKING. An alarm WAILING.

    YOUNGER JOSH
    (panicked)
    I just pressed print!

    BACK TO PRESENT

    JOSH
    The machine was defective.

    MAYA
    You tried to print 5,000 copies of your 
    face.

    JOSH
    It was for a vision board!

    Maya just stares at him.

    JOSH (CONT'D)
    A very important vision board.

    His phone BUZZES. Text message: "WHERE ARE YOU? TRADE WINDOW 
    CLOSING!"

    JOSH (CONT'D)
    (to himself)
    Okay. Conference room. Quick meeting. 
    Back to desk. Execute trade. Simple.

    He stands. Straightens his tie.

    MAYA
    Your fly's down.

    Josh looks down. Zips frantically.

    JOSH
    Why is Monday like this?

    MAYA
    (returning to work)
    It's Monday. It's literally designed to 
    be like this.

    CUT TO:

    INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

    Hendricks sits at the head of the table. FIVE OTHER EMPLOYEES 
    already seated. All look miserable.

    Josh enters. Everyone turns.

    JOSH
    Sorry, I—

    MR. HENDRICKS
    Sit. We're discussing the Q3 reports.

    Josh's phone BUZZES in his pocket. He ignores it.

    MR. HENDRICKS (CONT'D)
    Parker, since you're late, you can go 
    first.

    JOSH
    First for...?

    HENDRICKS slides a massive binder across the table.

    MR. HENDRICKS
    Present your department's findings.

    Josh opens the binder. It's completely blank.

    CLOSE ON - Josh's face. Pure terror.

    JOSH
    (panicked whisper)
    Oh no.

    His phone BUZZES again. And again. And again.

    ANGLE ON - Other employees exchanging glances.

    MR. HENDRICKS
    We're waiting.

    Josh flips through pages. All blank.

    JOSH
    I... there seems to be... a technical...

    His phone RINGS. Loud. The ringtone: "WHO LET THE DOGS OUT"

    Everyone stares.

    Josh fumbles to silence it. Drops the phone. It CLATTERS under 
    the table.

    He dives under.

    UNDER THE TABLE - Josh's POV

    Legs everywhere. Phone just out of reach.

    JOSH (O.S.)
    (muffled)
    Almost got it...

    BACK TO SCENE

    Josh emerges. Phone in hand. Hair disheveled. Tie askew.

    MR. HENDRICKS
    (long pause)
    Parker.

    JOSH
    Yes sir?

    MR. HENDRICKS
    Get out.

    JOSH
    Sir, I can explain—

    MR. HENDRICKS
    Out. Now.

    Josh stands. Backs toward the door.

    JOSH
    Right. Yes. Going. Out.

    He exits.

    SMASH CUT TO:

    EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - PARKING LOT - DAY

    Josh bursts through the doors. Checks his phone.

    TEXT MESSAGE: "TOO LATE. TRADED YOUR WHOLE TEAM FOR NOTHING. 
    -DAVE"

    JOSH
    (to the sky)
    DAAAAAAAVE!

    A SECURITY GUARD walks past.

    SECURITY GUARD
    You okay buddy?

    JOSH
    (defeated)
    I have a vision board that says I am.

    The guard walks away slowly. Josh slumps against the wall.

    His phone RINGS. MOM calling.

    He answers.

    JOSH (CONT'D)
    (into phone)
    Hi Mom... No, today's actually going 
    great.

    FADE OUT.
