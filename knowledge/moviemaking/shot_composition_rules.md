## 1. Introduction

There are many ways to film the same scene. The director’s decisions depend on what experience they want the audience to have. Knowing what shot composition is and how to use it is vital to visual storytelling. Shot composition is more than arranging scene elements in a camera frame. It is an art that combines those elements to advance the story, reveal character, and create emotion.

Knowing the rules of shot composition and using them well can keep your audience engaged from beginning to end.

## 2. Rules of Composition

### 2.1 What is Composition?

- *Composition** refers to the way elements of a scene are arranged in a camera frame. Shot composition refers to the arrangement of visual elements to convey an intended message.

### 2.2 The Rules of Shot Composition

First, just like any "rules" in [photography](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-photography-definition/) or [cinematography](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-cinematography/), the rules of composition are made to be broken. As much as we rely on these rules in most cases, the [elements of composition](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-composition-in-art-definition/) are most exciting when they go against the grain.

## 3. Elements of Composition

### 3.1 The Rule of Thirds

The [rule of thirds](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-the-rule-of-thirds/) is one of the most common camera framing techniques used in film or photography. It's about positioning a character to show their relation to other elements in the scene.

### 3.2 Balance and Symmetry

Understanding frame composition rules is invaluable knowledge for [directors](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-does-a-director-do/) and cinematographers. Shooting a perfectly [symmetrical shot](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/wes-anderson-symmetry/), breaking the [rule of thirds](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-the-rule-of-thirds/), is used for very specific reasons.

## 4. Film Composition Techniques

### 4.1 Leading Lines

[Leading lines](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-are-leading-lines-definition/) are actual lines (or sometimes imaginary ones) in a shot, that lead the eye to key elements in the [scene](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-scene-definition/).

### 4.2 Eye-Level Framing

[Eye-level framing](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/eye-level-camera-shot-angle/) positions the audience at eye-level with the characters, which plants the idea that we are equal with the character.

## 5. Composition Examples

### 5.1 Depth of Field

[Depth of field](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/depth-of-field/) describes the size of the area in your image where objects appear acceptably sharp.

### 5.2 Rack Focus

A [rack focus](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/rack-focus-shot-camera-movement-angles/) in filmmaking is changing the focus during a shot.

### 5.3 Bokeh

[Bokeh](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-bokeh-effect/) is the circular blurring produced from out of focus images.

## 6. Deep Space Composition

- *Deep space composition** is used when significant elements in a scene are positioned both near and far from the camera. These elements do not have to be in focus.

## 7. Conclusion

The rules of composition are more like suggestions. They are meant to guide and assist, not to limit or prohibit. There are many instances when you really should obey the rules of composition, and other times when breaking them is ideal. A filmmaker like Dan Gilroy and a film like *Nightcrawler* are great examples of how to play with the rules of composition.
