# Document Summary

This document provides a comprehensive guide to understanding depth of field (DOF) in filmmaking and photography. It covers the definition, techniques, and applications of DOF, including shallow and deep depth of field, the circle of confusion, and how various factors like sensor size, aperture, and focus distance govern DOF. The guide also includes practical examples and related video content to illustrate these concepts.

# Depth of Field Definition

## What is depth of field?

- *Depth of field (DOF)** is the term used to describe the *size of the area* in your image where objects appear acceptably sharp. The area in question is known as the *field*, and the size (in z-space) of that area is the *depth* of that field. DOF is governed by the angle at which light rays enter the lens.

The larger your camera sensor, the more your depth of field decreases. This is because you are forced to move closer to your subject to fill your frame. You can manipulate your DOF through aperture, and focus distance.

The center most point of the field is known as the *point of focus*. The imaginary two-dimensional plane that extends from that point is known as the *plane of focus*.

Any part of your image that falls directly on this plane is officially *in focus*.

[Depth of field](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-depth-of-field-definition/) is a spectrum and provides a number of variations that bring different effects to different shots. It produces many types of [camera focus](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-focus-in-film/) in film. For a complete breakdown of these options, watch our episode of The Shot List that is dedicated to [depth of field and camera focus](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-depth-of-focus-definition/).

# Understanding Depth of Field

## Let's break down depth of field...

You have a hallway of infinite depth. 

Walk forward and place a door at the **20 ft** mark.

Continue deeper into the hallway and place another door at the **50 ft** mark.

The **area** in z-space between these two doors is known as your **field**.

The **distance** between these two doors is the **depth** of your **field**.

The *area* **(field)** is the physical space.

The *distance* **(depth)** is the measurement of that space.

In the example above...

Our first door is placed at the **20 ft** mark.

Our second door is placed at the **50 ft** mark.

Therefore, your *DOF* is...

- *30 ft**

Leave your first door placed at the **20 ft** mark.

Move your second door to the **90 ft** mark.

Now, your *DOF* is...

- *70 ft**

In each instance, you have a field, but the depth of that field is determined by how much space is between each door.

Objects that fall *in between* those doors would be *acceptably sharp*, and any objects that fall *outside* of those doors would *not*.

# Depth of Field: Circle of Confusion

## What is the circle of confusion?

The [circle of confusion](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-circle-of-confusion-photography/) is the measurement of a point source of [film light](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/film-lighting/) that falls on the focal plane. The diameter of this circle is measured by fractions of millimeters. This light is never truly in focus, which is why the size of the circle of confusion is used to determine the quality of a [lens](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/different-types-camera-lenses-explained/). The smallest circle a lens can generate (circle of least confusion) registers a light source in “perfect focus.”

This is used to measure lens precision. Once you’ve calculated the circle of confusion, you can then accurately determine how precise the focus of your lens will be, and paired with the [focal length](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/focal-length-camera-lenses-explained/), you can determine the hyperfocal distance of a particular lens.

Testing the circle of confusion is a very useful method for lens and camera manufacturers to test focus, because it helps determine when a subject is officially *out of focus*.

It also is a really good way of establishing the value of a lens and its construction, because the smaller the circle of least confusion is, the more precise (possibly expensive) your lens will be.

Generally:

More expensive lens = Smaller circle of least confusion

# Shallow Depth of Field

## What does shallow depth of field actually do?

[Shallow depth of field](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-shallow-depth-of-field/) is the term used to describe an image that has a shorter field distance. Therefore the region of acceptable sharpness is smaller, and has a higher drop-off rate.

A shallow DOF can isolate your subject and cloud surrounding objects.

This allows a [director](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-does-a-director-do/) to elicit several different emotions from the viewer. Some of these include severity, loneliness, fear, doubt, extreme beauty, heightened senses, and anger.

Regardless of the feeling you want to generate, you should make it a point to plan out and [make a shot list](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-to-make-a-shot-list/) with the intended depth of field for each shot.

You can do this by simply checking the box for DOF on your [shot list](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-shot-list-example/), and you can mark shallow depth of field, or mark it deep if you need to see [imagery](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-imagery-definition-examples/) that is further back in the frame.

A shallow depth of field may help with the emotional [tone](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-tone-in-literature-definition/) of your image, but it will rarely take you as far as most [cinematographers](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-cinematographer-definition/) need.

Some of the most beautiful [shots](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-camera-shots/) have used a shallow depth of field, as well as some of the most disturbing shots (still beautiful in their own way).

You need to use subject matter, performance, lighting, [color](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-to-use-color-in-film-50-examples-of-movie-color-palettes/), and [camera movement](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/different-types-of-camera-movements-in-film/) to help with the rest of the journey.

### SHALLOW DEPTH OF FIELD EXAMPLE:

Here's one example of a shallow DOF being used in modern television.

In *The Night Of*, the shallow depth of field not only creates an eerie tone, but it also plays into the detective aspect of the story.

You are literally looking for evidence in the frame.

# Deep Depth of Field

## So what is a large depth of field?

Large depth of field is the term used to describe an image that has a deeper field, therefore the region of acceptable sharpness has a lower drop-off rate. This can be used to capture a larger area of acceptably sharp images.

This can also be referred to as a *deep* depth of field, and some cinematographers will simply use the term *“depth”* to describe shots with a large DOF. It can also be referred to as *deep focus*.

# Depth of Field in Cameras

## What governs depth of field?

There are various ways to control your depth of field. Each method has a profound impact on the area of acceptable focus, but combining multiple methods will allow incredible control over your images.

Here are some ways to govern DOF:

### SENSOR SIZE

The *larger* your [camera sensor](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/camera-sensor-size/), the more your depth of field *decreases*. This is because you are forced to move closer to your subject to [fill your frame](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/fill-the-frame-photography-definition/).

That doesn't mean you should buy a camera because it has a smaller sensor, but it is something to keep in mind with regard to governance.

### APERTURE

[Aperture](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-aperture/) describes the light intensity of a specific image or set of images based on the amount of light that was allowed to pass through to the sensor or film. This is measured by [F-Stops](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-f-stop-in-photography-definition/) (Estimated) and [T-Stops](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-t-stop-camera-lens-definition/) (Exact).

- *Note**: The lower the f stop number, the higher the aperture.

When you increase the diameter of your aperture, you physically change the angle at which light rays may enter the lens.

This spreads the angle to make it wider, which squishes your field closer together, and thus creates a shallower depth of field.

When you decrease the diameter of your aperture, you physically change the angle at which light rays may enter the lens.

This squishes the angle to make it thinner, which spreads your field further apart, and thus creates a larger depth of field.

### FOCUS DISTANCE

When you get very near a subject you will notice that your depth of field becomes more shallow. This happens regardless of the focal length of your lens.

It is a myth that longer lenses give you a shallower depth of field.

If you were to put a longer lens on your camera, it would magnify your subject, and this creates the same depth of field you would get with a wide lens very near the subject. This is why longer lenses *appear* to give you shallower DOF.

You aren’t actually changing the depth of field by putting a longer lens on your camera, but rather moving your camera closer (without having to get any closer).

If your subject takes up the same amount of space in the frame, you will have the same depth of field regardless of focal length.

The magnification of the lens not only simulates being closer to the subject, but it also magnifies the actual blurring effect in the unfocused parts of the image.

### CAMERA DISTANCE

The physical distance of camera-to-subject changes your depth of field for the same reasons as your aperture and focal length.

Camera distance can also be referred to as [focus distance](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-focus-in-film/), because as you move your camera, you are forced to change the position of the focal element within the body of the lens to keep your subject in focus.

### LENS FILTERS

[Lens filters](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-diffusion-filter-definition/) can help you control your depth of field in specific instances. This is most useful in those rare moments when you have too much light, but you don’t want to stop down.

If you are [planning on shooting a scene](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-to-plan-a-film-shoot-time/) in particularly harsh, bright light, but you still want to get an image with a shallow depth of field, [consider using a neutral-density filter](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/uv-protection-lens-filter/) to decrease the light intensity.

This will help you keep images appropriately exposed despite having the relatively wide aperture that gives you the shallow look you desire.

Neutral density filters don’t change the angle at which light rays enter the lens. They simply reflect a small amount of light so that your [exposure](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-the-exposure-triangle-explained/) is lowered.

ND filters do not affect color, and can help reduce reflection in your images.

Combine the forces that govern depth of field to achieve some really spectacular results. If you’re a [cinematographer](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-cinematographer-definition/), you need to understand each of these forces more than anyone on set.

If you’re a [director](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-does-a-director-do/), you always want to understand as much as possible with regard to creative decisions, including depth of field.

Howard Hawks, [Patty Jenkins](https://www.studiobinder.com/tag/patty-jenkins/), John Waters; all directors with unique styles and tone. Each have profound control over the depth of field in their images.

While it doesn't relate directly with depth of field; it's still critical to understand what achromatic lenses are.

# Depth of Field: Selective Focus

## Blur anything and everything

Selective focus is a technique where a photographer or filmmaker uses an extremely shallow depth of field to isolate a subject.

This heavily blurs the background and [foreground](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/foreground-elements-in-photography/) to such an extreme level that the surrounding is completely obscured.

So, whenever an extremely shallow depth of field is used to capture an image, selective focus is at work. A large amount of light is often needed to achieve selective focus, so keep that in mind.

## Depth of field for long takes...

If you're going to be filming a long take in your next project, you may want to keep your depth of field as large as you can. Based on the knowledge you just picked up, you may have already determined how you would film a [long take](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/long-take-sequence-shot-camera-movement-angle/).

For instance, if you are attempting to film a shot like the one *in the video below*, you'll want to stay [wide](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/wide-shot-camera-angles-movements-examples/), but you also keep a large depth of field.

At the very beginning when *Henry* hands the car keys off to his friend, you'll notice the depth is more shallow. Why? Because the subject was closer to the camera, but as they move through the scene they remain in focus.

They weren't changing lenses or settings, but they used their actors and [blocking](https://www.studiobinder.com/filmmaking-techniques-film-blocking/) to create a shot with different layers of depth of field, and achieved a really amazing shot that both isolated information, but also stayed in focus.

Consider calculating your depth of field beforehand if you know you're going to film a long take. This may help you pull off some difficult goals.
