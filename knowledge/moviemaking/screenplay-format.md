## For Comic Books

Adapt screenplay format for sequential panels:

```
PAGE 1

PANEL 1 - ESTABLISHING SHOT
INT. ASHFORD LIBRARY - NIGHT

Detective Morgan enters the vast, shadowed library.
Rain streaks the tall windows. Victor Ashford's body
lies slumped at his desk.

CAPTION (NARRATOR)
The silence in this house was louder
than any scream.

PANEL 2 - CLOSE-UP
Morgan's gloved hand holds a jeweler's loupe over
a small antique key on the floor.

MORGAN
(to himself)
The obvious frame always misses
the small things.

PANEL 3 - MEDIUM SHOT
Morgan stands, addressing a forensic tech.

MORGAN
I want fiber analysis on that key.
High-level. Now.
```

## Scene Density for Page Count

- **40-page comic**: ~80-120 panels (2-3 panels per page)
- **Scenes needed**: ~25-35 distinct scenes
- **Acts**: 5-7 major story beats

## Integration with Detective Stories

Each scene should include:
1. **Location/Time** (slugline)
2. **Action** (visual description)
3. **Clue reference** (if applicable)
4. **Dialogue** (character-attributed)
5. **Panel specification** (shot type, composition)
