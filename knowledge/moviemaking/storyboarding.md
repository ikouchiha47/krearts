# Document Summary

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to create a storyboard using StudioBinder. It covers the importance of storyboarding in filmmaking, defines what a storyboard is, and outlines the essential elements and steps involved in creating an effective storyboard for video projects.

# Introduction

It’s always good to go into a creative endeavor with a plan. Whether it’s for a music video, ad campaign, or short film, a storyboard can be extremely useful. Storyboards help you outline your vision and understand how you’ll go about creating your project. But many creators still ask, “How do you create a storyboard that’s both clear and compelling?” Never used a storyboard before? You might be wondering, “How do I make a storyboard that works?” Fear not. In this post, we’ll look at how to make a storyboard for video, why you should, and the elements you should include.

# Learning How to Make a Storyboard Improves Workflow

## Understanding the Basics

The process of taking the vision in your head and turning it into images on screen usually begins with a [storyboard](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-storyboard/). Learning how to make a storyboard for video ensures your ideas translate seamlessly from concept to execution.

This serves two functions:

1. Refine your ideas on paper
2. Share them with your [film crew](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/film-crew-positions/).

Therefore, the more you understand how to make a storyboard, the more efficient it can be, especially when it comes to storyboarding and planning videos with complex sequences or multiple locations.

# Storyboard Definition

## What is a Storyboard?

A **storyboard** is a visual representation of a film sequence that breaks down the action into individual panels. It serves as a crucial tool in visual storytelling, sketching out how a video sequence will unfold, and functions as a trial run for your finished film, video, or commercial, laid out in a comic book-like form.

## Storyboard Elements

- Images or illustrations panels
- Scene descriptions
- Shot numbers
- Storyboard arrows
- Timing information
- Notes and annotations

# How to Make a Storyboard for Video Projects

## 7 Steps to Make a Storyboard

Once you understand ‘what is a storyboard,’ building one should feel exciting – this is the sandbox where you can visually plan how your project will look, ensuring that every [shot](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shots-sizes-in-film/) and sequence aligns with your creative vision. Here’s a step-by-step guide using [StudioBinder's storyboard creator](https://www.studiobinder.com/storyboard-creator).

Even though we're using a particular software, the process is universal — whether you're working digitally or with good old pencil and paper.

## Step 1: Choose Your Presentation Format

Before you start gathering images, drawing panels, [hiring a storyboard artist](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/8-websites-to-find-hire-a-storyboard-artist/), or doing any nuts-and-bolts illustration and [pre-visualization](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-previs-previsualization-in-film/) work, you need to choose [how you want to present your storyboards](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-to-display-storyboards/).

If you want to draw basic, straightforward sketches, you may want to create a board with twelve panels on a page. Using a [storyboard template](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/downloads/storyboard-template/) can help structure your visuals efficiently, especially when you’re learning how to storyboard for different formats and presentation styles. But if you want your illustrations to be detailed and complex, you may want larger frames, especially if you’re asking yourself, “How do I make a storyboard that stands out visually?”

The latter technique is typically the preferred option if you are planning on using your boards to pitch your project since you can wow potential clients or investors with your visuals.

With StudioBinder, you can toggle between view types. This means that if you change your mind on your approach later, it’s no sweat. You can easily choose a different format.

Whether you prefer a 4-column view...

...Or a one-column storyboard, you have the option.

![How to Make a Storyboard - One Panel Storyboard](https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-to-Make-a-Storyboard-1-Panel-Storyboard-StudioBinder-Storyboarding-Software.png)

## Step 2: Read the Scene

It should come as no surprise that to make a good storyboard, you need to understand the scene you’re boarding. What is the core purpose of the sequence? What are you trying to get across? How is the [plot](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-plot/) moving forward, and how are the characters affected? If you’re asking yourself, “How do I create a storyboard that captures all of this?”—this step is where it begins.

All these considerations will inform your [shot choices](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shots-sizes-in-film/) and [camera movement](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/different-types-of-camera-movements-in-film/), which is why learning how to make a storyboard for a video can give you a huge creative edge.

![How to Make a Storyboard Tagging shots from a script](https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/How-to-Make-a-Storyboard-Tagging-shots-from-a-script-1.png)

## Step 3: Create or Find Your Images

Once you’ve determined the [aspect ratio](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/aspect-ratio/) and other settings for your project, you’ll need to start creating or gathering images. [Storyboard software](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/best-storyboard-software-free-storyboard-templates/) can help organize your visuals efficiently and maintain consistency across scenes. A storyboard template can provide a consistent framework for organizing your shots.

There are two options. The first is the old-school method of drawing out each panel—a great choice if you’re wondering how do you create a storyboard without digital tools. How can you make a storyboard for video if you can't draw? Even simple stick figures can effectively convey movement, composition, and framing—especially if you’re just learning how to storyboard without formal drawing skills. Here are some alternative [storyboarding methods for non-artists](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/how-to-storyboard-if-you-cant-draw/).

The second option is the more modern incarnation of using storyboarding software and sourcing pre-existing visuals. You can take photos of your own or use images from TV shows and movies as your visual references.

Many filmmakers use storyboard software to streamline this process and enhance their visuals, often pulling from storyboarding examples to guide their layout and framing. As long as they communicate your vision, there's no reason not to.

## Step 4: Add Arrows

You can use [storyboard arrows](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/storyboard-arrows-meaning/) to indicate movement. Is a character walking across the frame? Is it a [close-up](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/close-up-shot/) shifting to a [wide shot](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/wide-shot-camera-angles-movements-examples/)? Or a [tracking shot](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/tracking-shot-camera-movement-definition/) following the main character? How do I make a storyboard that includes camera motion? Here are some quick examples of how arrows are used to [indicate a moving camera](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/storyboard-camera-movement/).

![How to Make a Storyboard Add arrows to your board](https://s.studiobinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/How-to-Make-a-Storyboard-Add-arrows-to-your-board.jpg)

The video below shows how to easily add, resize, and adjust arrows in StudioBinder using a simple drag-and-drop tool. Watch to see how this feature enhances clarity and brings your storyboards to life!

## Step 5: Include Descriptions and Annotations

Now it’s time to add descriptions that will ensure the intention of each panel is clear. This can include shot descriptions, special notes, and visual annotations, key elements when learning how to write a storyboard that speaks clearly to your team.

If you're using software like StudioBinder, you can add [storyboard notes](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/storyboard-notes-annotations/) along with [dialogue](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-dialogue-definition/) and [shot specs](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shots-sizes-in-film/). You can then quickly add arrows and text to mark how things are moving. Don’t like what you’ve added? You can always re-do the step.

## Step 6: Share and Collaborate

It’s time to take your finished panels and distribute them to your team.

If you’re [pitching a video concept](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/pitch-video-concept/), now is when you pull back the curtain on your boards and share them with clients. Or, you can share it with your cinematographer and other relevant departments to get their thoughts.

You can also send the board to your actors or models to allow them to know what to expect on set. If you’re asking, “How do you create a storyboard that everyone can understand?”, this is where clarity and collaboration matter. A storyboard maker can help generate clear, professional visuals that communicate scene details effectively, particularly when you’re still figuring out how to write a storyboard that aligns with your team’s needs. This step in creating a storyboard ensures that performers understand [blocking](https://www.studiobinder.com/filmmaking-techniques-film-blocking/) and camera movements ahead of time. Usually, this means sending a PDF.

But even better than that, using an online storyboard allows for easy collaboration, real-time feedback, and seamless updates throughout the [pre-production](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-pre-production-definition/) process. That being said, if you’re using StudioBinder, sharing is easy with just a few clicks. [Directors](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-does-a-director-do/) and [1st ADs](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-does-an-assistant-director-do/) may want edit access to elaborate on shot specs or [manage shooting locations](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/shooting-location-management-in-film/).

Others, like clients or executives, may want comment access to provide feedback. You can share with a view-only link, or let collaborators work on specific pages rather than the entire project. No matter what kind of special needs your project has, with storyboarding software, you can make real-time adjustments and collaborate seamlessly with the team.

## Step 7: Print

You’ve done all the hard work, so you’ll want to make sure you have your boards at your disposal on set. Providing copies to your production team ensures that everyone stays on the same page throughout filming. Printing a storyboard template ensures every department has a clear visual reference. Creating a storyboard is only half the battle—this means printing out hard copies to hand out to departments. This will ensure that everyone is on the same page.

StudioBinder’s customizable [PDF generator](https://support.studiobinder.com/en/articles/10336071-how-to-generate-a-pdf-of-your-storyboards) allows you to print boards with professional presentations with added security, ideal for anyone learning how to storyboard for professional shoots. You can hide/include shot specs, determine your page layout, choose whether to have color, create front and back covers, add custom watermarks, and select headers and footers.
