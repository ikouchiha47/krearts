# Document Summary

This document explores the concept of continuity editing in film, detailing its definition, techniques, and importance. It also discusses the reasons for breaking continuity editing through discontinuity editing, providing examples and insights into the decision-making process of filmmakers.

# Introduction

Some say that when the editor does their job well, the audience is not supposed to notice. This does not mean that the editor’s job is unimportant. In fact, the complete opposite is the case. Editors are responsible for maintaining the illusion of a film and story by hiding the mechanisms at work. The main tool they have to do this is continuity editing.

# What is Continuity Editing in Film?

## Definition

- *Continuity editing** is an editing system used to maintain consistency of both time and space in the film. Continuity editing helps ground audiences in the reality of the film while establishing a clear and structured narrative. The goal of continuity editing is to make the mechanisms of filmmaking invisible to help the audience dismiss disbelief more easily. Continuity editing, also referred to as three-dimensional continuity, is the predominant editing style among commercial Hollywood films.

## Techniques of Continuity Editing

- Eye line
- Eye trace
- 180-degree rule
- Matching action

# Continuity in Film Techniques

## Eyeline

The [eyeline match](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-an-eyeline-match/) is one of the most fundamental tools in continuity editing. It aims to fulfill the expectation of an audience to see what a character is looking at when they are looking off screen. When the scene is a dialogue between multiple people, one character often looks screen left while the other character looks screen right to maintain the consistency that these characters are looking at each other. This is fundamental when shooting [over the shoulder](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/over-the-shoulder-shot/), shot reverse shot scenes.

## 180-Degree Rule

If you have taken a class on editing or [cinematography](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-cinematography/), one of the first rules you will learn about is the [180-degree rule](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-the-180-degree-rule-film/). The 180-degree rule is meant to orient the audience and help them understand where characters are in relation to each other and their environment. Filmmakers create an imaginary line between two subjects in a scene and keep every camera setup on the same side of this line, within the same 180 degrees.

## 30-Degree Rule

Sometimes filmmakers cut from one shot of a character to a different shot of the same character either to change the [shot angle](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shot-angles-in-film/) or cut to different [shot sizes](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/types-of-camera-shots-sizes-in-film/). To avoid jarring discontinuity editing or a [jump cut](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/what-is-a-jump-cut/#:~:text=A%20jump%20cut%20differs%20from,objects%2C%20subjects%2C%20or%20settings.), the two different shots must be taken from at least 30-degrees apart.

## Matching Action

Editing to match the action of characters is one of the most basic tools of continuity editing. A match on action cut is a staple of what some editors refer to as invisible editing. Matching action aims to cut on the same frame of a character’s action between two shots. In this action scene from *[Mad Max: Fury Road](https://www.studiobinder.com/tag/mad-max-fury-road/)*, pay attention to every cut and notice how many cut on the action of a character to make the scene smooth in consistent shot to shot.

## Eye Trace

Eye trace is a technique and part of [Walter Murch's Rule of Six](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/walter-murch-rule-of-six/) that allows an editor and director to direct the audience's eyes and attention toward a specific detail on screen through a cut. For example, if the first shot has a subject in the bottom left of the screen, the next shot may have an important plot detail in the same position to ensure the audience will see it.

# Why Continuity Editing?

## The Importance of Continuity

The goal of continuity editing is to keep the illusion of time and space in the film intact. If it is broken, it can be distracting to an audience, removing them further from the film. Yet, continuity errors can be found in many major pictures. This video by This Guy Edits analyzes the importance of continuity editing in film.

# Discontinuity Editing

## Why Break Continuity Editing?

Discontinuity editing fractures logic and structure. Editors of films may need to disorient or disturb the audience to effectively tell the story. This is often the case in indie films, psychological thrillers, non-linear films, and experimental films. In early [Soviet Montage Theory](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/soviet-montage-theory/), discontinuity editing was highly-valued and utilized to construct more expressive and political films.

In one of [Stanley Kubrick’s best films](https://www.studiobinder.com/blog/best-stanley-kubrick-movies/), *[The Shining](https://www.studiobinder.com/tag/the-shining/)*, Kubrick completely breaks the 180-degree rule in a scene to match the oddity of the dialogue.
