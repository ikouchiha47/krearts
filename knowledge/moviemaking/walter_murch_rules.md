# Document Summary

This document explores Walter Murch's "Rule of Six," a set of guidelines for film editing that prioritize emotion, story advancement, rhythm, eye trace, the 180-degree rule, and spatial continuity. The article provides detailed explanations and examples from notable films to illustrate each rule's application and impact on storytelling.

# Introduction

Directors and cinematographers shoot with purpose, matching their technical shot choices with the intended tone or emotion of the story. Editors play a crucial role in assembling scenes to convey the emotional truth of the story. Walter Murch, an Oscar-winning editor, outlined helpful tools in his book, *In the Blink of an Eye*, detailing The Rule of Six, which discusses six categories that make for a great cut.

# The Rule of Six

## Cut for Emotion

Murch values emotion first, accounting for over 50% of what makes a great cut. The key question is how the cut affects the audience emotionally at that moment. The tone of the film should align with the emotional experience intended. An example is the restaurant scene in *The Godfather*, where sound editing plays a vital role in conveying Michael's inner turmoil.

## Advance the Story Cuts

The second rule focuses on whether the edit advances the story. The plot of a film should not be confused with the story. For example, in *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*, the non-linear editing serves the story by reflecting the protagonist's memory erasure process, enhancing the emotional experience.

## Maintaining Rhythm

Rhythm connects the emotional tone and story. The pacing should support the emotion in the story. Murch describes rhythm as "the music of the cut." An example is the ending scene in *Bonnie and Clyde*, where rhythm conveys the sudden, inevitable death of the characters.

## What is Eye Trace?

Eye trace is a technique that guides viewers' eyes to certain areas of the frame through blocking, camera moves, color, lighting, and cuts. It helps control what the audience sees and can be used to hide or reveal information. An example is the use of eye trace in *Fight Club* to foreshadow Tyler Durden's presence.

## Using the 180-Degree Rule

The 180-degree rule is a cinematography guideline that maintains the left/right relationship between characters in a scene. Crossing the line can confuse the audience but can be used intentionally to create disorientation, as seen in *The Shining*.

## Physical Space in a Scene

This rule ensures that the audience understands the spatial relationships within a scene. Breaking this rule can support the film's tone, as seen in *Inception*, where characters walk on walls, aligning with the dream-like narrative.
