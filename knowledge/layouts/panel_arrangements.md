## Panel Aspect Ratios

Different panel arrangements work best with specific aspect ratios:

### Horizontal Layouts (2-3 panels side-by-side)
- **Recommended Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 (Landscape)
- **Orientation**: Landscape
- **Best for**: Wide establishing shots, action sequences, dialogue exchanges
- **Layouts**: horizontal-2-panel, horizontal-3-panel

### Vertical Layouts (2-3 panels stacked)
- **Recommended Aspect Ratio**: 9:16 (Portrait)
- **Orientation**: Portrait
- **Best for**: Descent/ascent sequences, character focus, zoom progressions
- **Layouts**: vertical-2-panel, vertical-3-panel, zoom-progression

### Square/Balanced Layouts
- **Recommended Aspect Ratio**: 1:1 (Square) or 4:3
- **Orientation**: Square or Landscape
- **Best for**: Balanced compositions, grid layouts
- **Layouts**: dynamic-grid, fractured-overlapping

### Dominant Panel Layouts
- **Recommended Aspect Ratio**: Varies (typically 16:9 or 3:2)
- **Orientation**: Landscape
- **Best for**: Dramatic reveals, impact moments
- **Layouts**: cross-over-bleed, shattered-exploded

**IMPORTANT**: When generating panels, always specify the aspect ratio and orientation in the visual_description to ensure consistent image generation.

You are absolutely right. My sincere apologies again. I've been focusing so much on making the "dynamic" part clear that I neglected to maintain the specific "2-3" count within the phrasing for the horizontal and vertical templates.

The "2-3" refers to the *number* of panels in that split (either two or three). I need to ensure that the template itself correctly presents that choice.

Let's fix that.

### **Prompt for a Totally Horizontal 2 or 3-Panel Layout**

**Overall Layout & Arrangement:**
* **Panel Arrangement:** **[Specify "2 panels" or "3 panels"]**, arranged horizontally with significant dynamic variation. The panels are not of equal size; they vary in width and/or height. They are also staggered or offset along the horizontal axis, not perfectly aligned at the top or bottom. The layout feels energetic and visually irregular.
* **Panel Borders:** Clean, sharp borders, but with subtle angles or deliberate offsets where panels meet, implying visual tension rather than perfect separation.

**Panel 1 Description:**
* **Focus/Subject:** \[Describe the main action, character, or object in this panel.]
* **Setting/Background:** \[Describe the environment, time of day, key details.]
* **Composition/Angle:** \[e.g., "Close-up," "Wide shot," "Over-the-shoulder," "Dynamic low angle."]

* **Setting/Background:** \[Describe the environment, time of day, key details. Note if it's the same as Panel 1 or different.]
* **Composition/Angle:** \[e.g., "Close-up," "Wide shot," "Over-the-shoulder," "Dynamic low angle."]
* **Specific Details:** \[Any unique elements, emotions, props, text/speech bubbles for this panel.]

**Panel 3 Description (Optional - Only if 3 panels are specified):**
* **Focus/Subject:** \[Describe the main action, character, or object in this panel.]
* **Setting/Background:** \[Describe the environment, time of day, key details. Note if it's the same as previous panels or different.]
* **Composition/Angle:** \[e.g., "Close-up," "Wide shot," "Over-the-shoulder," "Dynamic low angle."]

Okay, based on creativity and usability in storytelling for a **"Spider-Verse Inspired Halftone Comic Noir"** style, I'll select three distinct and impactful layout styles. I'll then generate a prompt for each, adhering to your detailed template format, and then produce the corresponding image.

My top 3 choices for creativity and storytelling usability are:

1.  **Cross-Over/Bleed-Out Layout:** For emphasizing a dominant element's impact.
2.  **Shattered/Exploded Panels:** For conveying chaos, impact, or psychological distress.
3.  **Zoom-In Progression:** For building suspense and focusing on crucial details.

---

### **Cross-Over/Bleed-Out Layout (for a Powerful Reveal)**

This is great for revealing a menacing figure or an overwhelming force that "breaks" the bounds of the narrative.

**Prompt for Cross-Over/Bleed-Out Layout:**

**Overall Layout & Arrangement:**
* **Panel Arrangement:** A large, imposing figure is seen bleeding across multiple vertical panels, its form so dominant it ignores the panel divisions. Smaller, distinct panels are arranged to its side, showing details.
* **Panel Borders:** Sharp, clean borders for the smaller panels, which are dramatically cut by the central figure.

**Panel 1 Description (Left Panel - smaller):**
* **Focus/Subject:** A detective's hand, holding a small, old photograph of a missing person.
* **Setting/Background:** A desk surface, dimly lit, cluttered with noir detective paraphernalia (ashtray, empty coffee cup).
* **Composition/Angle:** Close-up on the hand and photograph.
* **Specific Details:** The photograph is faded, showing a smiling face now shrouded in tragedy.

**Panel 2 Description (Central Dominant Figure, spanning multiple "slots"):**
* **Focus/Subject:** A towering, muscular antagonist, heavily cloaked and shadowed, with a menacing, almost monstrous silhouette. Its face is obscured in darkness but hints at cold fury. Its form cuts across the full height and most of the width, bleeding through where panels would typically be.
* **Setting/Background:** A dark, brick-walled basement or lair, with only hints of industrial machinery visible in the deep background.
* **Composition/Angle:** Extreme wide shot of the figure, imposing and dominating the entire vertical space.
* **Specific Details:** A single, sharp gleam of light off a metallic accessory or weapon held by the figure.

**Panel 3 Description (Right Panel - smaller):**
* **Focus/Subject:** The detective's face, jaw clenched, eyes narrowed in grim realization.
* **Setting/Background:** The implied darkness of the room, reflecting the horror of the central figure.
* **Composition/Angle:** Close-up on his face.
* **Specific Details:** A subtle beads of sweat on his brow, emphasizing his fear.


Excellent! For the final creative and usable layout, let's go with the **Zoom-In Progression**. This is fantastic for building suspense, focusing attention on a crucial detail, or slowly revealing information.

---

### **Zoom-In Progression Layout (for Building Suspense/Focusing Detail)**

This layout style is highly effective for building tension towards a reveal, emphasizing a small but critical element, or slowing down time to highlight a particular moment.

**Prompt for Zoom-In Progression Layout:**

**Overall Layout & Arrangement:**
* **Panel Arrangement:** 3 panels, arranged horizontally, depicting a progressive zoom-in, starting wide and ending in an extreme close-up.
* **Panel Borders:** Clean, sharp borders, giving a sense of precise, controlled focus.

**Panel 1 Description (Wide Shot):**
* **Focus/Subject:** A male figure (e.g., a detective or a suspicious character) standing alone in a deserted, dimly lit storage room, looking around cautiously.
* **Setting/Background:** Stacks of dusty crates, old industrial shelving, and a single bare lightbulb casting long shadows. A cold blue glow emanates from something unseen in the far corner.
* **Composition/Angle:** Wide shot, slightly high angle, emphasizing the solitude and size of the room.
* **Specific Details:** Dust motes visible in the slivers of light.

**Panel 2 Description (Medium Shot - Zoomed In):**
* **Focus/Subject:** The male figure now closer to the source of the blue glow, his hand reaching out to touch or examine an object. His face is tense with curiosity or apprehension.
* **Setting/Background:** Closer view of the crates and shelving, with the cold blue light becoming more defined.
* **Composition/Angle:** Medium shot, slightly low angle, focusing on the character's interaction with the object.
* **Specific Details:** The faint reflection of the blue light on his face.

**Panel 3 Description (Extreme Close-Up - Final Zoom):**
* **Focus/Subject:** An extreme close-up on a small, intricate metallic object, perhaps an ornate key or a small device, emitting a faint, cold blue light. It sits on a dusty surface.
* **Setting/Background:** Heavily blurred background, focusing entirely on the object.
* **Composition/Angle:** Extreme close-up.
* **Specific Details:** The glint of light off its precise, cold steel edges, emphasizing its significance.

**Panels can have a maximum of 2-3 sub-panels**

Panel Transition Style (Under Overall Layout & Arrangement - for multi-panel):

Value: Hard cuts, Overlapping scenes, Blended transitions, Diagonal cuts, Frame-within-frame.

Why: While "fractured, overlapping comic panels" implies some of this, being more specific about how panels interact (e.g., if a scene from one panel literally "bleeds" into the next) could offer more control.

Motion Representation (Under Overall Art Style & Aesthetic / Specific Details for Panels):

Value: Stylized speed lines, Motion blur, Impact lines, Ghosting/Duplication effects for speed.

Why: "Spider-Verse" is famous for its dynamic motion. While "graphic, stylized streaks" for rain hints at this, explicitly mentioning other forms of motion representation could be beneficial for action scenes.

Text & Typography Style (Under Specific Details for Panels - for speech/sound effects):

Value: Hand-lettered comic sans serif, Blocky, impactful sound effect lettering, Distressed, gritty font for narration.

Why: The style of text in comics is highly influential. Specifying how speech bubbles, sound effects, or narration should appear can reinforce the aesthetic.

Perspective & Camera Style (Under Composition/Angle for Panels):

Value: Exaggerated forced perspective, Cinematic wide-angle lens effect, Dutch angle (canted), Bird's eye view, Worm's eye view.

Why: While "Dynamic low angle" is good, explicitly calling for more advanced cinematic or comic book specific perspectives can enhance the visual drama.
