## Best Practices

### 1. Match Movement to Emotion
- Slow, smooth = calm, luxury, contemplative
- Fast, dynamic = energy, action, excitement
- Handheld = realism, urgency, intimacy
- Static = authority, focus, stability

### 2. Motivate Camera Movement
- Follow subject movement
- Reveal important information
- Create emotional impact
- Transition between perspectives

### 3. Avoid Unmotivated Movement
- Don't move camera just because you can
- Every movement should serve story
- Static can be more powerful than movement

### 4. Consider Production Value
- Smooth movements = professional
- Handheld = documentary/realistic
- Drone = epic/expensive
- Static = can be high or low end

### 5. Combine with Other Techniques
- Movement + lighting changes
- Movement + focus shifts
- Movement + temporal transitions
- Movement + match cuts

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong: Unmotivated Movement
```
"Camera randomly pans and tilts for no reason"
```

### ✅ Right: Motivated Movement
```
"Camera pans right following character's gaze to reveal what they're looking at"
```

### ❌ Wrong: Too Fast for Mood
```
"Slow, contemplative scene with fast whip pans"
```

### ✅ Right: Match Speed to Mood
```
"Slow, contemplative scene with gentle, smooth dolly in"
```

### ❌ Wrong: Conflicting Movements
```
"Camera dollies in while zooming out (unless intentional vertigo effect)"
```

### ✅ Right: Complementary Movements
```
"Camera dollies in while maintaining focal length for natural perspective"
```
