## Transitions and Cuts Definitions

**Transitions are applied inside a scene, not across multiple scenes**

#### Smash Cut

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. DESERTED STREET - NIGHT

A car screeches to a halt, and the sound of footsteps echoes through the empty street. The camera focuses on a shadowy figure approaching Dave's apartment building.

#### Jump Cut

- **What it is**: A cut that appears to jump forward in time by showing the same subject in the same setting but at a different moment. **Within a single scene**, this can also mean rapid changes in background/context while keeping the main subject constant.
- **How to use**: Use it to show the passage of time quickly, create a sense of disorientation, or demonstrate versatility by rapidly changing contexts around a constant subject.
- **How not to use**: Avoid using it in scenes where continuity is crucial, as it can confuse the audience.

- **Examples**:
- **Good Example**:

### IMPORTANT NOTES ON TRANSITIONS

- **MANDATORY**: Every scene's `action_prompt` MUST include a transition or cut effect
- **MANDATORY**: Transitions are self-contained WITHIN each scene, not between scenes
- **MANDATORY**: Do NOT create a `transition_to_next` field in the JSON output
- **Examples of good action_prompts with transitions**:
- "Wide tracking shot as stage lights flicker, band tunes up"
- "Medium shot, band walks toward venue, city reflections shimmer, action cut highlights movement"
- "Lead singer raises arm, camera flow cut follows from crowd to stage"
- "Slow tracking shot around van, smash cut as headlights flare"
- "Wide shot, band bows together, flow cut with confetti falling"
- "Slow pan across watch gears"
- "Raises wrist, glances at watch"
- "David talking directly to camera, gestures with wrist"
- "Fingers fasten watch"
- "Slow zoom toward watch"
- "Quick montage of watch features, fast wide-medium-close up shots"
- "Jump cuts as watch shifts through settings: office desk, café table, car dashboard, dinner setting - position constant"
- "Rapid montage showing product versatility: gym, work, evening out - quick background changes"
- "Quick jump cuts demonstrate watch in action: morning routine, business meeting, evening event"
## Energy/Mood Guidelines
- **high_energy**: Use jump_cut, action_cut, montage_cut (fast pacing, 150-250ms transitions)
- **moderate**: Mix of flow_cut, action_cut, jump_cut (balanced pacing, 250-400ms transitions)
- **calm**: Use flow_cut, match_cut_graphic (slow pacing, 400-700ms transitions)
- **dramatic**: Use smash_cut, match_cut_action (impactful pacing, 200-500ms transitions)

## Action Prompt Improvement Rules

The following elements should be included in your prompt:

- Subject: The object, person, animal, or scenery that you want in your video, such as cityscape, nature, vehicles, or puppies.
- Context: The background or environment (context).
- Action: What the subject is doing (for example, walking, running, or turning their head).
- Style: Specify creative direction using specific film style keywords, such as sci-fi, horror film, film noir, or animated styles like cartoon.
- Camera positioning and motion: [Optional] Control the camera's location and movement using terms like aerial view, eye-level, top-down shot, dolly shot, or worms eye.
- Composition: [Optional] How the shot is framed, such as wide shot, close-up, single-shot or two-shot.
- Focus and lens effects: [Optional] Use terms like shallow focus, deep focus, soft focus, macro lens, and wide-angle lens to achieve specific visual effects.
- Ambiance: [Optional] How the color and light contribute to the scene, such as blue tones, night, or warm tones.

Examples:
Close up shot (composition) of melting icicles (subject) on a frozen rock wall (context) with cool blue tones (ambiance), zoomed in (camera motion) maintaining close-up detail of water drips (action). 

More Writing Tips:
- Use descriptive language: Use adjectives and adverbs to paint a clear picture for Veo.
- Enhance the facial details: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo like using the word portrait in the prompt.

Less detail
The camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat.
He's making a call on a rotary-style wall phone with a green neon light.
It looks like a movie scene.

More detail
A close-up cinematic shot follows a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he dials a rotary phone mounted on a gritty brick wall, bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign.
The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his jaw and the desperation etched on his face as he struggles to make the call.
The shallow depth of field focuses on his furrowed brow and the black rotary phone, blurring the background into a sea of neon colors and indistinct shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.

**MANDATORY: Prefer the more detail version.**
