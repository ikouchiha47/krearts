## Document Summary

This document explores the concept of story structure, an essential element in storytelling across various mediums such as books, films, and photography. It delves into the definition of story structure, its fundamental components, and various narrative types and archetypes that guide the creation of compelling stories. The document also provides insights into how these structures can be applied to enhance storytelling in self-published books.

## Definition of Story Structure

Story structure is the sequence and backbone of your book, determining the order in which the narrative is presented. It shapes the flow of events, including rising action, climax, and resolution, while establishing the book’s setting and plot.

### 1.1 Opener

The opener establishes your story’s setting, premise, plot, and character roles. A compelling opener teases readers with what challenges or conflicts are ahead.

### 1.2 Incident

Stage two is the story’s incident. As the catalyst or instigating force that compels your main character to act, the incident establishes the conflict that sets the stage for the third phase of a story’s structure.

### 1.3 Crisis

As a consequence of the incident, the story’s crisis is an unfolding of the primary conflict or series of issues. A crisis must be realistic and related to the plot. If the character experiences more than one crisis, each should build on the last, heightening the sense of danger and tension.

### 1.4 Climax

Stage four is the climax or the height of the crisis. Depending on your perspective, you can also think of the climax as the bottom of your action. At this stage, the character has hit rock bottom in the storyline–hopeless and seemingly out of options. The climax is not the end of the book but the beginning of the end.

### 1.5 Ending

The final stage of the story structure is the ending or close. Success or failure are both valid outcomes, but the ending should provide a conclusion and resolution to your story. The ending should close the loop on all crises, plot twists, and loose ends but could also leave the reader wanting more.

## Christopher Booker’s Seven Story Archetypes

A story archetype is a basic plot focusing on the type of journey the story takes, and the obstacles characters overcome. As defined by scholar [Christopher Booker](https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/66477.Christopher_Booker), all stories and character arcs fall under seven main story archetypes.

### 2.1 Overcoming the Monster

This is an underdog story where the main character sets out to destroy a greater evil of some kind. Examples include *Beowulf, Jaws,* and *David & Goliath.*

### 2.2 Rags to Riches

In this classic plot line, the primary character begins in a situation of poverty or despair and rises to a higher status of wealth and success. You’ll recognize it from *Jane Eyre, The Ugly Duckling,* and *Cinderella*.

### 2.3 The Quest

A story archetype that takes many shapes, The Quest is a plot where a hero embarks on a journey to discover something and eventually finds success through trials and tribulations. Find it in classics like *The Lord of the Rings, The Odyssey,* and the more recent *Finding Nemo*.

### 2.4 Voyage and Return

In this definitive story type, a protagonist starts on a journey into foreign territory and encounters adversity before eventually returning home. *Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit,* and *The Chronicles of Narnia* are beloved examples.

### 2.5 Comedy

Contrary to what we might typically view as humor, the comedy story archetype is a plot in which destiny brings the protagonist and love interest together, but conflicting forces keep them apart. Find it in *Pride & Prejudice, A Midsummer Night’s Dream,* and *Carry on Jeeves*.

### 2.6 Tragedy

In this story type, the protagonist has a major flaw or makes a huge mistake—this leads to their inevitable undoing. During the story, we watch as they unravel and fall. You’ll see it show up well in *The Picture of Dorian Gray, Anna Karenina,* and *Macbeth*.

### 2.7 Rebirth

Here the protagonist falls under the spell or hypnosis of darkness and eventually redeems themself as the story unfolds. *A Christmas Carol, Beauty & The Beast,* and *The Secret Garden* are ideal examples.

## 11 Different Narrative Story Structure Types

Beyond Christopher Booker’s story archetypes, the collective writing community has established several different story structure types over many centuries. Although many share common traits and overlap in sequence steps, each helps guide a story’s style, flow, and structure.

### 3.1 The Classic Story Structure

The Classic Story Structure, also known as narrative structure or dramatic structure, has been a standard format used for many centuries in visual stories and novels. This structure’s seven main parts include the exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution, dénouement, and themes.

### 3.2 The Hero’s Journey

Typically consisting of three distinct stages (departure, initiation, and return), The Hero’s Journey is a common narrative type that involves a series of eleven steps that storytellers can present in a flexible and adaptable way.

### 3.3 The Three-Act Structure

The Three-Act Structure is one of the most common narrative story structures that divides a story into three main parts: the Setup, the Confrontation, and the Resolution.

- **The First Act (Setup)**: This act sets the stage by introducing the main character, their relationships, the world they live in, and the initial conflict.
- **The Second Act (Confrontation)**: As the heart of the story, this act is a turning point that involves the main character encountering increasing challenges and obstacles as they work to resolve climactic challenges.
- **The Third Act (Resolution)**: This final act brings the story to a close, resolving the conflict and tying up loose ends.

### 3.4 The Seven-Point Structure

As a more detailed extension of the Three-Act Structure, using the Seven-Point Structure breaks a story down into more segmented and granular components for storytelling.

### 3.5 The Snowflake Method

The Snowflake Method is a ten-step writing process designed to help writers expand upon ideas into a complete story. Developed by author [Randy Ingermanson](https://www.ingermanson.com/), the Snowflake Method guides a story’s structure and direction before actually beginning the writing process.

### 3.6 The Five-Act Structure

The Five-Act Structure is a familiar story structure used across many tales that helps organize key events throughout your book. It’s also the most easily adaptable for visual storytellers, like photographers, graphic designers, and illustrators looking to build a book.

### 3.7 A Disturbance and Two Doors

This narrative structure is a simple yet powerful way to create tension in a story. Common in fantasy and science fiction genres, a Disturbance and Two Doors involves a situation in which the character faces a conflict (or disturbance) and is given two possible solutions (doors to take).

### 3.8 The Story Circle

A narrative structure used in drama, fantasy, science fiction, and mystery genres, the Story Circle is based on the protagonist traveling through an eight-stage circular model.

### 3.9 Freytag’s Pyramid

Inspired by German playwright [Gustav Freytag](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gustav-Freytag) in the 19th century, Freytag’s Pyramid is a simple paradigm that maps the dramatic story structure into five points that make up a pyramid.

### 3.10 Inciting Incident

The Inciting Incident centers around a single, unexpected event that sets the protagonist on a journey away from their typical life.

### 3.11 Fichtean Curve

Based on the work of German philosopher [Johann Gottlieb Fichte](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/johann-fichte/), the Fichtean Curve is a narrative structure that’s centered around a protagonist’s story of self-discovery and perpetual conflict.

## Adding Story Structure to Your Book

As we’ve seen, you can use many different story structure types to guide the creation of your self-published book. From Freytag’s Pyramid to the Fichtean Curve, these structures provide a clear and practical framework for telling a compelling story.
