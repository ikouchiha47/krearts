# Chapter Mapping Index

## Overview

Chapter mapping is the **practical application** of narrative structures to specific mediums (novels, screenplays, comics). It translates abstract structural phases (Exposition, Rising Action, Climax) into concrete chapter/scene divisions.

**Key Distinction**:
- **Narrative Structure** = Conceptual pattern (Freytag's Pyramid, 3-Act, etc.)
- **Chapter Mapping** = Medium-specific implementation (15 chapters for novella, 90 chapters for novel)

## Available Mappings

### Linear Novel Mapping
- **File**: `chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`
- **Purpose**: Maps linear (chronological) narrative structures to novel chapters
- **Supports**: 
  - Freytag's Pyramid
  - Three-Act Structure
  - Five-Act Structure
  - Hero's Journey
- **Scalable**: Adapts to different novel lengths (novella, novel, epic)

### Non-Linear Novel Mapping
- **File**: `chapter-mapping/non-linear-novel-mapping.md`
- **Purpose**: Maps non-linear (non-chronological) narrative structures to novel chapters
- **Supports**:
  - In Medias Res
  - Pulp Fiction Structure (interwoven timelines)
  - Memento Structure (reverse chronology)
  - Bookend (circular)
  - Flashback/Flash-forward
  - Fractured/Puzzle
- **Scalable**: Adapts to different novel lengths with timeline tracking

### Screenplay Mapping (Future)
- **File**: `chapter-mapping/screenplay-mapping.md`
- **Purpose**: Maps narrative structures to screenplay pages/scenes
- **Supports**: 3-Act (industry standard), 5-Act (TV), Save the Cat

## How to Use

1. **Select narrative structure** from `narrative-structures/index.md`
2. **Determine if linear or non-linear**:
   - Linear: Chronological storytelling (Freytag, 3-Act, 5-Act, Hero's Journey)
   - Non-Linear: Time manipulation (In Medias Res, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc.)
3. **Consult appropriate mapping file**:
   - Linear → `linear-novel-mapping.md`
   - Non-Linear → `non-linear-novel-mapping.md`
4. **Apply scaling formula** based on target length
5. **Enforce genre rules** (detective principles, romance beats, etc.)

## Relationship to Other Knowledge

```
Narrative Structure (abstract pattern)
         ↓
Chapter Mapping (medium-specific implementation)
         ↓
Genre Principles (detective, romance, etc.)
         ↓
Narrative Techniques (storytelling methods)
```

**Example Flow**:
1. Choose **Freytag's Pyramid** (narrative structure)
2. Apply **novel mapping** → 15 chapters for novella
3. Enforce **detective principles** → ≥5 clues before climax (Ch 1-7)
4. Use **narrative techniques** → False Confirmation in Ch 2, Slow-burn Pivot in Ch 5
