# Linear Novel Chapter Mapping

## Overview

This document maps **linear narrative structures** (chronological storytelling) to novel chapters with scalable formulas for different lengths.

**Base Assumptions**:
- Novella: 15,000 words → 15 chapters (1,000 words/chapter avg)
- Novel: 90,000 words → 90 chapters (1,000 words/chapter avg)
- Epic: 150,000 words → 150 chapters (1,000 words/chapter avg)

**Adjustable**: Words per chapter can range from 800-1,200 depending on pacing needs.

## Freytag's Pyramid Mapping

### Structure Overview
Six phases with clear dramatic arc:
1. Exposition
2. Inciting Incident
3. Rising Action
4. Climax (reversal/turning point)
5. Falling Action
6. Resolution/Denouement

### Chapter Distribution (15-chapter novella)

| Phase | Chapters | Percentage | Purpose |
|-------|----------|------------|---------|
| **Exposition** | 1-3 | 20% | Establish world, characters, baseline mystery state |
| **Inciting Incident** | 3-4 | Overlap | Disturbance that forces protagonist to act |
| **Rising Action** | 4-7 | 27% | Complications, clue gathering, stakes escalate |
| **Climax** | 8-10 | 20% | Pivotal reveal/proof that flips understanding |
| **Falling Action** | 11-12 | 13% | Consequences, confessions, alliances exposed |
| **Resolution** | 13-15 | 20% | New equilibrium, thematic closure |

### Scaling Formula

```
For N total chapters:
- Exposition: Chapters 1 to ceil(N × 0.20)
- Inciting: Chapter ceil(N × 0.20) to ceil(N × 0.27)
- Rising: Chapter ceil(N × 0.27) to ceil(N × 0.47)
- Climax: Chapter ceil(N × 0.47) to ceil(N × 0.67)
- Falling: Chapter ceil(N × 0.67) to ceil(N × 0.80)
- Resolution: Chapter ceil(N × 0.80) to N
```

**Examples**:
- 90-chapter novel: Exposition (1-18), Inciting (18-24), Rising (24-42), Climax (42-60), Falling (60-72), Resolution (72-90)
- 5-chapter short story: Exposition (1), Inciting (1-2), Rising (2-3), Climax (3-4), Falling (4), Resolution (5)

### Detective Genre Application

**Exposition (Ch 1-3)**:
- Establish detective POV and baseline
- Introduce victim context
- Plant initial suspicion/red herring seed
- **Clue requirement**: First clue by end of Ch 3

**Inciting Incident (Ch 3-4)**:
- Body found / call to scene / first incontrovertible anomaly
- Detective commits to investigation

**Rising Action (Ch 4-7)**:
- **Clue density**: ≥5 clues total by end of Ch 7
- Balance red herrings vs. true clues (≤40% red herrings)
- Evidence hierarchy: Introduce ≥3 types (forensic, financial, behavioral)
- Suspect interviews and contradictions surface

**Climax (Ch 8-10)**:
- **Proof chain locks**: Multilayered forensics + motive tie-in + temporal plausibility
- Decisive evidence revealed (tool mark, fiber, phone metadata)
- Confrontation with killer

**Falling Action (Ch 11-12)**:
- Formal confessions
- Exonerations (framed suspect cleared)
- Contracts/ledgers/alliances exposed

**Resolution (Ch 13-15)**:
- Public exoneration
- Status changes (inheritance, freedom, arrest)
- Detective's thematic beat (justice vs. convenience)

## Three-Act Structure Mapping

### Structure Overview
Classic screenplay structure adapted for novels:
1. Act I: Setup (25-33%)
2. Act II: Confrontation (50%)
3. Act III: Resolution (17-25%)

### Chapter Distribution (15-chapter novella)

| Act | Chapters | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----|----------|------------|---------|
| **Act I (Setup)** | 1-5 | 33% | Introduce world, establish stakes, inciting incident |
| **Act II (Confrontation)** | 6-11 | 40% | Complications, obstacles, midpoint reversal |
| **Act III (Resolution)** | 12-15 | 27% | Climax, falling action, denouement |

### Key Turning Points

- **End of Act I** (Ch 5): Point of no return, detective fully committed
- **Midpoint** (Ch 8): Major revelation that shifts investigation direction
- **End of Act II** (Ch 11): All seems lost / darkest moment
- **Climax** (Ch 12-13): Final confrontation and proof
- **Resolution** (Ch 14-15): Wrap-up and thematic closure

### Scaling Formula

```
For N total chapters:
- Act I: Chapters 1 to ceil(N × 0.33)
- Act II: Chapter ceil(N × 0.33) to ceil(N × 0.73)
- Act III: Chapter ceil(N × 0.73) to N
```

### Detective Genre Application

**Act I (Ch 1-5)**:
- Crime discovered
- Initial suspects introduced
- First clues planted
- Detective accepts case (point of no return)

**Act II (Ch 6-11)**:
- False leads and red herrings
- Midpoint revelation (Ch 8): Major clue shifts suspicion
- Evidence accumulation
- Darkest moment (Ch 11): Killer seems to have perfect alibi

**Act III (Ch 12-15)**:
- Breakthrough evidence (Ch 12)
- Confrontation and confession (Ch 13)
- Consequences and exoneration (Ch 14)
- Thematic resolution (Ch 15)

## Five-Act Structure Mapping

### Structure Overview
Shakespearean/dramatic structure:
1. Exposition
2. Rising Action
3. Climax
4. Falling Action
5. Denouement

### Chapter Distribution (15-chapter novella)

| Act | Chapters | Percentage | Purpose |
|-----|----------|------------|---------|
| **Act I (Exposition)** | 1-3 | 20% | Setup, inciting incident |
| **Act II (Rising Action)** | 4-6 | 20% | Complications begin |
| **Act III (Climax)** | 7-9 | 20% | Peak tension, major reversal |
| **Act IV (Falling Action)** | 10-12 | 20% | Consequences unfold |
| **Act V (Denouement)** | 13-15 | 20% | Resolution, new equilibrium |

### Scaling Formula

```
For N total chapters (equal distribution):
- Act I: Chapters 1 to ceil(N × 0.20)
- Act II: Chapter ceil(N × 0.20) to ceil(N × 0.40)
- Act III: Chapter ceil(N × 0.40) to ceil(N × 0.60)
- Act IV: Chapter ceil(N × 0.60) to ceil(N × 0.80)
- Act V: Chapter ceil(N × 0.80) to N
```

### Detective Genre Application

**Act I (Ch 1-3)**:
- Crime scene establishment
- Initial investigation begins

**Act II (Ch 4-6)**:
- Clue gathering intensifies
- First major suspect emerges

**Act III (Ch 7-9)**:

- Major confrontation or revelation

**Act IV (Ch 10-12)**:
- Confession obtained
- Alliances/betrayals exposed
- Framed suspect exonerated

**Act V (Ch 13-15)**:
