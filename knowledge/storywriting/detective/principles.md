# Principles of Detective Story Writing

## Core Principles (short)

Every claim must have provenance. If the Detective states “X happened,” there must be at least one referenced clue (paper, ledger, fiber, timestamp).

Red herrings must be plausible. Red herrings should be explainable later by routine causes (cleaning habit, misdelivered letter), never mystical.

Motives must be concrete. For every alliance or complicity, record the explicit stake (e.g., Dr Price loses license if ledger published) and put a trace that proves it exists (email/transfer/ledger).

Reveal chain = breadcrumb chain. Each reveal must be reconstructible by following clue IDs in order.

## Narrative Patterns

**Note**: For detailed explanations of detective narrative techniques, see `narrative-techniques.md`

Quick reference of common patterns:

**Slow-burn pivot**: Stage multiple small interviews that gradually collapse the alibi via contradictions.

**False confirmation**: Give a convincing early "confirmation" of frame (blood on scarf) and later explain its origin as inserted staged evidence — but only after showing how that evidence could plausibly be planted.

**Emotional trigger reveal**: A character confesses not because they need to, but because a presented fact (ledger/record) makes continued lying costlier.

See `narrative-techniques.md` for 16 detailed techniques including: Breadcrumb Chain, Convergent Evidence, The Overlooked Detail, Contradiction Trap, The Gathering, and more.

## Evidence Distribution Checklist (**MUST PASS**)

For each storyline you generate, require these checks:

Evidence density: ≥ 5 clues total; ≥ 2 that directly implicate killer; ≥ 1 that directly exonerates framed suspect.

Red-herring balance: #red-herrings ≤ 40% of clues.

Motivation tie-in: For each alliance/betrayal, there is at least one financial or reputational concrete proof (transaction, threatened note, email, ledger).

Temporal plausibility: Killer has opportunity — timestamped presence or gap in logs covering window of murder.

Forensic corroboration: At least one physical clue (DNA/fiber/glove marks) connecting killer to scene or planted object.

If any check fails, the critique crew returns prioritized fixes.

## Clue Types (**MUST BE PRESENT**)

A few examples:
- PAPER / HANDWRITING (stationery watermark, phrasing)
- LEDGER / FINANCIAL TRANSFER (transaction id, timestamp)
- PHYSICAL_FIBER / GLOVE_FIBER / DIRT (lab report id)
- CCTV / ACCESS_LOG / PHONE_METADATA (timestamped)
- WITNESS_STATEMENT (quote with time/place)
- BEHAVIORAL (habit—bell ring, polishing pattern)
- PUZZLE_SOLVING


## Common Critique Points (Anti-Patterns to Avoid)

### Thin Accomplice Motivations
**Problem**: Accomplice alliances lack concrete stakes or leverage.
**What to check**: Does each alliance have explicit proof of mutual benefit or coercion?
**Required evidence types**:
- Financial records (transactions, ledgers, receipts)
- Reputational threats (documents, recordings, witness statements)
- Mutual leverage (each party has dirt on the other)

### Illogical Risk Calculus
**Problem**: Characters take risks without clear protection or insurance.
**What to check**: Why would someone involve a potential witness/accomplice who could implicate them?
**Required logic**:
- Mutual assured destruction (both parties vulnerable)
- Transactional necessity (each needs what the other provides)
- Explicit leverage shown (not just implied)

### Single-Layer Forensics
**Problem**: Case relies on only one type of evidence.
**What to check**: Are there multiple independent evidence types?
**Best practice**: Use at least 3 different evidence types from the hierarchy below.

### Perfunctory Framing
**Problem**: Framing attempts lack internal logic or plausibility.
**What to check**:
- How did the framer obtain the planted evidence?
- Could the framed person plausibly have been at the scene?
- Is there a "slip" (framer's mistake) that exposes the frame?
- Does the framing show planning and knowledge of the victim's habits?

### Detective Leaps Without Evidence
**Problem**: Deductions appear without showing the reasoning chain.
**What to check**: Can each deduction be traced back to specific clues?
**Required structure**: Clue A → Deduction 1 → Clue B → Deduction 2 → Conclusion
**Show the work**: Use internal monologue, dialogue, or scene description to walk through logic.

### Weak Red Herrings
**Problem**: Red herrings are never explained or feel supernatural.
**What to check**: Does each red herring have a mundane explanation?
**Valid explanations**: Routine habits, coincidences, misunderstandings, misdelivered items.
**Invalid**: Mystical occurrences, unexplained phenomena, abandoned plot threads.

## Forensic Evidence Hierarchy (Strength Order)

Ranked from strongest to weakest evidentiary value:

1. **DNA/Blood Evidence** - Direct biological link, nearly impossible to fake
2. **Fingerprints** - Unique identification, requires direct contact
3. **Fiber/Trace Evidence** - Clothing fibers, glove residue, carpet threads
4. **Tool Marks/Weapon Trace** - Unique patterns from specific implements
5. **Handwriting/Document Analysis** - Stationery, ink chemistry, phrasing patterns
6. **Digital Evidence** - Timestamps, phone records, access logs, CCTV footage
7. **Financial Records** - Ledgers, bank transactions, receipts, invoices
8. **Witness Testimony** - Can be unreliable, requires corroboration
9. **Behavioral Patterns** - Habits, routines (weakest, needs supporting evidence)

**Best Practice**: Build cases using at least 3 different types from this hierarchy. Single-source evidence is vulnerable to challenge.

## Critique Workflow

When evaluating a detective storyline:

1. **Count clues**: Verify ≥5 total, ≥2 implicating killer, ≥1 exonerating framed suspect
2. **Check motivations**: Each alliance/betrayal must have concrete proof (not just description)
3. **Verify forensics**: Multiple evidence types from different hierarchy levels
4. **Trace deductions**: Each detective conclusion must reference specific clues
5. **Test plausibility**: Framing attempts must have internal logic
6. **Explain red herrings**: All false leads must have mundane explanations
7. **Validate timeline**: Killer must have documented opportunity (timestamps, access logs)

If any check fails, return prioritized fixes with severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
