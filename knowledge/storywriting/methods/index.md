# Story Writing Methods (Workflows) – Index

Workflows are step-by-step processes for writers to plan and expand stories. They are orthogonal to narrative structures.

- Workflows = how to build the story (writer’s process)
- Structures = the blueprint (what the audience experiences)

See structures: `knowledge/narrative-structures/index.md`
See chapter mapping: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/index.md`

## How to Use with Chapter Mapping

After choosing a structure, apply:
- Linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`
- Non-linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/non-linear-novel-mapping.md`

Anchor key beats (Catalyst, Midpoint, All Is Lost, Finale) within the recommended chapter ranges for your target length.
