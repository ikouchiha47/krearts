# The Hero's Journey: The Workflow

This document describes how to use The Hero's Journey as a **writing workflow** or **outlining method**. It is a step-by-step guide for the writer to map their story against the 12 stages.

This is different from the file in [knowledge/narrative-structures/](knowledge/narrative-structures/), which describes The Hero's Journey as a final blueprint for the story.

## 1. Workflow vs. Structure: The Difference

| Aspect | **As a Workflow (This File)** | **As a Structure** ([narrative-structures](knowledge/narrative-structures/)) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To **instruct** the writer on how to plan the protagonist's arc. | To **describe** the final shape of the protagonist's journey. |
| **Audience** | The writer. | The audience (and the AI analyzing the story). |
| **Focus** | The **"How-To"** (How do I plan my hero's "Call to Adventure"?) | The **"What"** (What is the "Call to Adventure" stage?) |

## 2. The Workflow: How to Outline Your Story

Use this as a checklist to build your protagonist's journey. For each of the 12 stages, answer the writer's action prompts.

### Act 1: Departure

1.  **The Ordinary World:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* How do you show the hero's normal life before the adventure? What is missing or what makes them discontent?

2.  **The Call to Adventure:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* What event or person disrupts the hero's life and presents them with a challenge or quest?

3.  **Refusal of the Call:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* Why does the hero hesitate or refuse? What are their fears or insecurities?

4.  **Meeting the Mentor:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* Who gives the hero the training, equipment, or confidence they need? What wisdom do they impart?

5.  **Crossing the Threshold:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* What action does the hero take to fully commit to the adventure, leaving their Ordinary World behind?

### Act 2: Initiation

6.  **Tests, Allies, and Enemies:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* What are the first few challenges the hero faces? Who helps them (allies) and who hinders them (enemies)?

7.  **Approach to the Inmost Cave:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* As the hero nears their goal, what preparations do they make? What are the final obstacles before the biggest challenge?

8.  **The Ordeal:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* This is the hero's darkest moment or greatest fear. They face death (physical or metaphorical) and seem to fail. What is this central crisis?

9.  **Reward (Seizing the Sword):**
    *   *Writer's Action:* Having survived death, what does the hero gain? It can be an object, knowledge, or a new perspective.

### Act 3: Return

10. **The Road Back:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* How does the hero try to return to their world? What are the consequences of their actions in the Ordeal? Is there a chase?

11. **The Resurrection:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* The hero faces one final, ultimate test. They must use everything they've learned to succeed. This is the climax. How do they prove they have truly changed?

12. **Return with the Elixir:**
    *   *Writer's Action:* The hero returns to their Ordinary World, but brings back something to share (the "elixir"). How has their return changed their world and themselves?

## 3. Chapter Mapping (Apply)

Use chapter mapping to translate this workflow into concrete chapter counts and ranges (Hero's Journey is typically linear):

- Linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`

Tip: Anchor stages as follows: Call to Adventure early; Crossing the Threshold ends Act 1; Ordeal near late Act 2; Resurrection is the climax; Return with the Elixir closes the resolution.
