# Snowflake Method (Storywriting Workflow)

A method for incrementally expanding an idea into a complete story. This is a planning/expansion workflow, not a narrative structure. It is orthogonal to linear/non-linear timeline choices and works with any narrative structure you select.

## 1. Overview: Method vs. Structure
- **Narrative Structure**: The temporal organization of events (e.g., Hero’s Journey, Three-Act, Freytag). Defines phases, turning points, and pacing.
- **Snowflake Method**: A stepwise expansion process (sentence → paragraph → pages/chapters). Guides how you elaborate content, not how you order time.
- **Use Together**: Choose a structure first, then use Snowflake to flesh it out into chapters and scenes.

## 2. The 10 Steps (as described in source article)
1. Write a single-sentence summary of the story’s overarching premise.
2. Expand that single sentence into a full paragraph describing the story in greater detail.
3. Expand the paragraph into a one-page story synopsis.
4. Construct a character chart of the story’s main characters and their roles.
5. Write a single sentence that describes each scene of the story.
6. For each scene sentence, compose a paragraph that adds greater detail about the scene’s events.
7. Write a complete chapter for each significant scene.
8. Complete a full draft of the story.
9. Revise the story’s draft as needed.
10. Edit the story and its structure, and organize the flow to be most engaging.

## 3. How to Use with Narrative Structures
- Select a narrative structure from `knowledge/narrative-structures/index.md` (e.g., `linear/heros-journey.md`, Three-Act, Five-Act).
- Determine if the structure is linear or non-linear.
- Keep the structure’s phases and turning points visible during every Snowflake step.
- When expanding (Steps 5–7), tag each scene/chapter with its structure phase (e.g., “Act II—Rising Complications” or “Initiation: Trials”).

## 4. How to Use with Chapter Mapping
- Read and apply the chapter mapping appropriate to your structure:
  - Linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`
  - Non-linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/non-linear-novel-mapping.md`
- Use the provided scaling formulas and phase distributions to decide chapter counts and ranges.
- During Steps 5–7:
  - Allocate scene/chapter counts per structure phase per mapping.
  - Ensure required beats/turning points fall within mapped ranges.
- During Step 10 (final edit): verify chapter lengths and distributions respect mapping percentages.

## 5. Detective Overlay (Genre Constraints During Expansion)
Apply detective-specific rules alongside Snowflake expansion to maintain fair-play and plausibility.

- **Evidence Hierarchy** (see `knowledge/storywriting/detective/principles.md`):
  - Forensic/physical > financial/paper trail > behavioral/psychological.
  - Require high-grade evidence to justify critical accusations and reveals.
- **Clue Density Targets**:
  - By midpoint: ≥ required minimum number of credible clues (see principles file).
  - Limit red herrings (≤ allowed percentage) and ensure each has a mundane explanation.
- **Chain of Custody & Provenance**:
  - Log who found evidence, where, when, and how it was verified (embed in scene beats during Steps 6–7).
- **Opportunity, Motive, Means (OMM) Checks**:
  - At each outline expansion (Steps 2–6), verify top suspects satisfy or fail OMM with explicit, checkable details.
- **Interrogation & Reveal Techniques** (see `storywriting/detective/storytelling-techniques.md`):
  - Choose techniques (e.g., slow-burn pivot, false confirmation, breadcrumb chain) per scene to modulate tension without violating fairness.
- **Phase-by-Phase QA**:
  - After each Snowflake step, run a short audit: Are clues discoverable earlier? Are reveals supported by prior evidence? Are coincidences minimized?

## 6. Practical Workflow Checklist
- Choose structure (linear/non-linear) and read its file.
- Load the chapter mapping file for that structure type and target length.
- Run Snowflake Steps 1–4 to lock premise and cast.
- Use mapping to scope Steps 5–7 (scene → chapter expansion) and place beats where required.
- Apply detective overlay at each step (evidence density, OMM, provenance).
- Draft (Step 8), revise (Step 9), and finalize (Step 10) with mapping percentages and detective rules verified.
