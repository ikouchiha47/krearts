# Save the Cat! Beat Sheet (Workflow)

A planning/outlining workflow breaking a story into 15 beats. This is a writer’s method, not a narrative structure. Use it after choosing a narrative structure and target length.

## 1. Workflow vs. Structure
- **Workflow (this file)**: How to outline your story step-by-step.
- **Structure (blueprint)**: Final story shape (e.g., Three-Act, Hero’s Journey) in `knowledge/narrative-structures/`.

## 2. The 15 Beats (Writer’s Checklist)
1. **Opening Image** – First impression of tone and world.
2. **Theme Stated** – A line or moment hinting at the story’s core idea.
3. **Set-Up** – Ordinary World, protagonist, stakes, relationships.
4. **Catalyst** – Inciting incident disrupts status quo.
5. **Debate** – Protagonist hesitates, weighs options.
6. **Break into Two** – Commitment to Act 2; journey begins.
7. **B Story** – Secondary thread (often relationships) begins.
8. **Fun and Games** – The premise at work; promises of the genre.
9. **Midpoint** – Major reversal: false victory/defeat or revelation.
10. **Bad Guys Close In** – Internal/external pressures escalate.
11. **All Is Lost** – Apparent defeat; “whiff of death.”
12. **Dark Night of the Soul** – Reflection; lesson crystallizes.
13. **Break into Three** – New plan with integrated lesson.
14. **Finale** – Execute plan; synthesize learnings to win/lose.
15. **Final Image** – Mirror of Opening Image; shows change.

## 3. How to Use (Quick Process)
- Pick a structure (e.g., Three-Act) and target length.
- List your 15 beats as one-liners.
- Expand each beat to a paragraph, then to scenes/chapters.
- Align beat placement with your chapter mapping (percentages/ranges).

---

## 4. With Chapter Mapping
- Use: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md` (for linear) or `.../non-linear-novel-mapping.md`.
- Place key beats near expected structural anchors:
  - Catalyst ≈ early Act 1, Midpoint ≈ 50%, All Is Lost ≈ late Act 2, Finale ≈ Act 3.

---

## 5. Detective Overlay (Optional)
- Enforce evidence hierarchy and clue density (see Principles).
- Make Midpoint a major evidence reversal; All Is Lost exposes a faulty inference.
- Finale must reconcile every planted clue and red herring.
