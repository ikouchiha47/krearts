# Three-Act Structure: The Workflow

This document describes how to use the Three-Act Structure as a **writing workflow** or **outlining method**. It is a step-by-step guide for the writer.

This is different from the file in [knowledge/narrative-structures/](knowledge/narrative-structures/), which describes the Three-Act Structure as a final blueprint for the story.

## 1. Workflow vs. Structure: The Difference

| Aspect | **As a Workflow (This File)** | **As a Structure** ([narrative-structures](knowledge/narrative-structures/)) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Purpose** | To **instruct** the writer on how to build an outline. | To **describe** the final shape of the story. |
| **Audience** | The writer. | The audience (and the AI analyzing the story). |
| **Focus** | The **"How-To"** (How do I plan my story's acts?) | The **"What"** (What is Act 1? What is the Inciting Incident?) |

## 2. The Workflow: How to Outline Your Story

Follow these steps to build your story using the Three-Act Structure as a planning tool.

### Step 1: Define Your Four "Tentpole" Moments

Before writing anything else, define the four key pillars of your story. These are the moments that hold the entire structure up.

1.  **The Inciting Incident (End of the Beginning of Act 1):** The event that kicks off the story and forces the protagonist to act.
    *   *Writer's Action:* What is the one event your story cannot start without?

2.  **The Break into Act 2 (The First Turning Point):** The moment the protagonist decides to commit to the journey. They can't turn back now.
    *   *Writer's Action:* What choice does your hero make that locks them into the main conflict?

3.  **The Midpoint (Middle of Act 2):** A major event that changes the stakes. It can be a false victory, a false defeat, or a major revelation.
    *   *Writer's Action:* What happens halfway through that raises the stakes and changes the hero's goal or understanding?

4.  **The Break into Act 3 (The Second Turning Point):** The moment after the hero's lowest point, where they find the strength or knowledge to face the final confrontation.
    *   *Writer's Action:* After everything seems lost, what gives your hero the final push they need to go into the climax?

### Step 2: Flesh Out Each Act

With your four tentpoles in place, fill in the gaps for each act.

-   **Act 1 (The Setup):**
    -   Introduce your protagonist in their Ordinary World.
    -   Establish their goals, flaws, and what they want vs. what they need.
    -   Build up to the **Inciting Incident**.

-   **Act 2 (The Confrontation):**
    -   *First half:* The protagonist reacts to the new world, facing rising complications. They are learning the rules.
    -   Lead to the **Midpoint**.
    -   *Second half:* The protagonist becomes proactive. The stakes are higher, and the villains are closing in. This culminates in the hero's lowest point (the "All Is Lost" moment).

-   **Act 3 (The Resolution):**
    -   Lead from the **Break into Act 3**.
    -   The **Climax:** The final confrontation between the hero and the antagonist.
    -   The **Resolution:** Tie up the loose ends. Show the hero in their new, changed world. What is their new normal?

### Step 3: Expand to Scenes

Take each bullet point from Step 2 and break it down into individual scenes. For each scene, write a one-sentence summary (e.g., "The detective finds the first clue, a bloody glove."). Arrange these scene cards until the pacing feels right.

Now you have a complete story blueprint, ready for you to start writing the actual chapters.

## 3. Chapter Mapping (Apply)

Use chapter mapping to translate this workflow into concrete chapter counts and ranges:

- Linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`
- Non-linear: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/non-linear-novel-mapping.md`

Tip: Place key waypoints near expected anchors (Catalyst early Act 1; Midpoint ≈ 50%; All Is Lost late Act 2; Finale in Act 3).
