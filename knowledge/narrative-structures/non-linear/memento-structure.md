# Memento Structure (Reverse Chronology)

## Overview

Story told backwards, starting with the end and working toward the beginning. Made famous by Christopher Nolan's *Memento*.

---

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Reverse Timeline
Each scene shows what happened BEFORE the previous scene

### 2. Mystery Building
Audience discovers "why" as they see "what"

### 3. Reveals Through Reversal
Understanding grows as we move backward

---

## Structure Pattern

```yaml
Chronological_Events:
  Event 1 → Event 2 → Event 3 → Event 4 → Event 5

Viewing_Order:
  Event 5 → Event 4 → Event 3 → Event 2 → Event 1

Effect: 
  - Start with result
  - Discover cause
  - Build understanding backward
```

## For 30-Second Ad

```yaml
structure:
  S1 (5s): Happy customer with product (END)
  S2 (5s): Customer receiving product (Event 4)
  S3 (5s): Customer ordering online (Event 3)
  S4 (5s): Customer researching product (Event 2)
  S5 (5s): Customer with original problem (BEGINNING)
  S6 (5s): Text: "Start your journey" + logo

effect: Shows result first, then reveals the path
```

---

## Example: Transformation Product

```yaml
S1 (4s): "THE END" - Confident person at event
S2 (4s): "1 WEEK EARLIER" - Person preparing for event
S3 (4s): "2 WEEKS EARLIER" - Person using product daily
S4 (4s): "3 WEEKS EARLIER" - Person trying product first time
S5 (4s): "1 MONTH EARLIER" - Person struggling, discovers product
S6 (6s): "THE BEGINNING" - Person's original problem
S7 (4s): Logo + "Your transformation starts here"
```

---

## Visual Indicators

```yaml
time_stamps:
  - "THE END"
  - "5 MINUTES EARLIER"
  - "1 HOUR EARLIER"
  - "YESTERDAY"
  - "THE BEGINNING"

color_grading:
  - Present (end): Vibrant, saturated
  - Recent past: Slightly desaturated
  - Distant past (beginning): More desaturated

transitions:
  - Fade to black between time jumps
  - Text overlay with time stamp
  - Reverse motion effects (optional)
```

---

## Variations

### 1. Pure Reverse
Every scene is earlier than previous

### 2. Alternating
Reverse scenes intercut with forward scenes

### 3. Reverse Montage
Quick cuts showing events in reverse

## For Different Lengths

### 15-Second Version
```yaml
S1 (3s): Result
S2 (3s): "EARLIER" - Step 3
S3 (3s): "EARLIER" - Step 2  
S4 (3s): "EARLIER" - Step 1
S5 (3s): Logo + CTA
```

### 30-Second Version
