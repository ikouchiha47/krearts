# Fichtean Curve (Narrative Structure)

A linear narrative structure emphasizing continuous escalation through successive crises leading to a decisive climax, with minimal exposition.

---

## 1. Overview (Blueprint)
- **Focus**: Momentum and pressure. The protagonist faces a chain of intensifying crises.
- **Shape**: Short setup → rising crises → climax → brief resolution.
- **Best for**: High-tension stories where character under fire reveals truth through action and consequence.

---

## 2. Core Phases
1. **Inciting Incident** – Disrupts status quo; problem becomes inescapable.
2. **Escalating Crises** – Repeated tests; each crisis forces new tactics and raises stakes.
3. **Climax** – The most consequential crisis; irreversible outcome.
4. **Resolution** – Short denouement; consequences shown; new equilibrium.

Notes:
- Crises are not filler—each must change knowledge, position, or risk.
- Backstory is revealed under pressure rather than in static exposition.

## 3. Mapping to Chapters (Linear)
- Use: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`.
- Allocate the majority of chapters to the Escalating Crises band.
- Place the Climax within the structure’s recommended final-phase range.

---

## 4. Detective Application (Optional)
- **Crises as Evidence Turns**: Each crisis reveals or invalidates key evidence.
- **Escalation**: Transition from behavioral → financial → forensic proof.
- **Climax**: Conclusive synthesis that survives adversarial scrutiny.
