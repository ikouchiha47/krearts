# Story Circle (Dan Harmon) – Narrative Structure

An 8-stage cyclical structure for character-driven stories. This file describes the structure as a final blueprint (what the audience experiences), not a writing workflow.

---

## 1. Overview (Blueprint)
- **Core idea**: A protagonist leaves comfort, faces change, pays a price, and returns transformed.
- **Shape**: Circular—need → unfamiliar → adaptation → obtain → pay → return → change.
- **Best for**: Character arcs and transformation-focused narratives.

## 2. The 8 Stages
1. **You (Comfort Zone)** – Establish the protagonist and their ordinary world. What’s missing?
2. **Need** – The protagonist wants something (lack, desire, problem).
3. **Go** – They enter an unfamiliar situation (cross the threshold).
4. **Search** – They adapt, learn rules, make allies/enemies, try/fail.
5. **Find** – They obtain what they wanted (object, knowledge, leverage).
6. **Take** – They pay a price or face consequences; stakes escalate.
7. **Return** – They go back to their familiar world or head to the final confrontation.
8. **Change** – They are transformed; demonstrate internal growth in action.

Notes:
- Stages 1–4 often map to early/mid build; 5–6 raise stakes; 7–8 resolve and prove change.
- The “price” (Stage 6) is essential; it validates the transformation.

## 3. Mapping to Chapters (Linear)
- Use: `knowledge/storywriting/chapter-mapping/linear-novel-mapping.md`.
- Allocate more chapters to stages 3–6 (adaptation → obtain → consequence) for momentum.
- Place the decisive consequence near late-stage ranges recommended by mapping.

## 4. Detective Application (Optional)
- **Need**: A compelling case gap (truth hidden, false narrative thriving).
- **Search**: Waves of clue gathering, interrogations, and failed hypotheses.
- **Find**: A pivotal insight or forensic proof.
- **Take**: A cost—credibility hit, suspect retaliation, legal risk.
- **Change**: The detective’s method or belief evolves; case resolution reflects growth.
