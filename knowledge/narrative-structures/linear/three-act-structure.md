## Structure

### Act 1: Setup (25% of runtime)
**Purpose**: Introduce world, characters, and conflict

**Key Elements**:
- **Opening Image**: Establishes tone and world
- **Exposition**: Who, what, where, when
- **Inciting Incident**: Event that disrupts normal life
- **Plot Point 1**: Decision/event that launches main story

**For 30s Ad**:
```yaml
duration: 7-8 seconds
content:
  - Show character's problem/need (3-4s)
  - Introduce product as solution (3-4s)
```

### Act 2: Confrontation (50% of runtime)
**Purpose**: Character pursues goal, faces obstacles

**Key Elements**:
- **Rising Action**: Complications increase
- **Midpoint**: Major revelation or setback
- **Obstacles**: Character struggles
- **Plot Point 2**: Lowest point, all seems lost

**For 30s Videos for Social Media**:
```yaml
duration: 15 seconds
content:
  - Show product in action (8-10s)
  - Demonstrate benefits (5-7s)
```

---

### Act 3: Resolution (25% of runtime)
**Purpose**: Climax and resolution

**Key Elements**:
- **Climax**: Final confrontation/decision
- **Resolution**: Loose ends tied up
- **Closing Image**: Mirrors or contrasts opening

**For 30s Ad**:
```yaml
duration: 7-8 seconds
content:
  - Show transformation/result (4-5s)
  - Call to action/logo (3s)
```
