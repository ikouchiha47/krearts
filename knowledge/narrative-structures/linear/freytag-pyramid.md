# Freytag’s Pyramid

## Overview
A classical six-part dramatic arc (often shown as a pyramid) for chronological stories. Useful when you want a clear rise, a decisive turning point, and a deliberate return to equilibrium.

Phases:
1. Exposition
2. Inciting Incident (modern addition to Freytag’s original five parts)
3. Rising Action
4. Climax (reversal/turning point)
5. Falling Action (consequences, unraveling)
6. Resolution/Denouement

---

## When to Use
- Classical drama and tragedy
- Detective and mystery plots that emphasize a single decisive reveal
- Stage-like, character-driven stories with moral or thematic reversal
- Clear emotional build and release over a single arc

Avoid when:
- You need many timelines or braided plots
- You rely on heavy non-linearity or puzzle-box structures

---

## Structure Details

### 1) Exposition
- Establish world, tone, and key relationships
- Plant baseline facts and initial mystery state

### 2) Inciting Incident
- Disturbance that forces the protagonist to act
- In detective stories: discovery of the crime or a trigger that makes the case unavoidable

### 3) Rising Action
- Progressive complications, clue gathering, suspect interviews
- Red herrings increase tension; stakes escalate
- Detective’s working theory evolves; contradictions surface

### 4) Climax (Reversal)
- Single pivotal reveal or proof that flips the understanding of events
- Detective publicly or privately proves the decisive link (e.g., tool mark + fiber + timeline)

### 5) Falling Action
- Consequences roll out from the climax
- Confessions, arrests, alliances exposed, reputations collapse

### 6) Resolution / Denouement
- New equilibrium; loose ends tied
- Thematic closure: justice vs. convenience, order vs. control, etc.

## Detective Story Mapping
- Exposition: Setting, victim context, baseline suspects, detective POV anchor
- Inciting Incident: Body found / call to the scene / first incontrovertible anomaly
- Rising Action: Evidence density increases (≥5 clues target), balance red herrings vs true clues (≤40% red herrings)
- Climax: Proof chain locks (multilayered forensics + motive tie-in + temporal plausibility)
- Falling Action: Formal confrontations, confessions, exonerations; contracts/ledgers/phone metadata surface
- Resolution: Public exoneration, status changes, detective’s thematic beat

## Tips
- Design the climax first (what locks the truth), then backfill the rising action with necessary clue provenance.
- Seed visual foreshadowing in Exposition that pays off at Climax.
- Ensure the falling action breathes: let viewers feel the cost of truth.
